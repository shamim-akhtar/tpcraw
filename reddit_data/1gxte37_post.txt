Body: Is anyone gonna mention ppl who approach you to offer you to be a partner for their e commerce business , via directly ‘recruiting’ physically or thru LinkedIn. 
Your experience ? Cause it seems soo shady, them advertising financial freedom thru multiple incomes, when the fact is that their business model only benefits the so called ‘Mentors’ where those under them earn barely to none.
