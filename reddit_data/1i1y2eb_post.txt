Body: The other post about the IIT syllabus made me want to bring up some lingering feedback that I had about the IIT building. Hope I can check if other students feel the same way.

# Benches/seats outside classrooms

This is the main reason for me to make this post. This especially applies to those who have classes in Block 3. I feel like there should be benches/seats outside the classrooms so that students have somewhere to sit if they arrive early for class (when the classrooms are still occupied or locked) or when they are are waiting for their turn for a presentation.

Alternatively (thanks /u/pokkagreentea100), both tables and chairs.

This problem seems to exist in the other IIT blocks as well, but those have such narrow hallways I don't think they have space.

# Visual appeal/bare walls

There is barely any decoration around the IIT classroom areas. The most I've seen is at Block 3 Level 5, and that's an Internet Explorer era wallpaper. It's not a big problem but it does make the school look less appealing, especially when you are going there for lessons every day.

The other blocks are even more spartan, from what I have seen. As one commentor in the other post described it, it looks like an abandoned factory. Not very appealing to the youth of 2025.

They seem to be able to come up with good enough illustrations for the big public areas (even though they're AI...), so I don't doubt they can come up with something (preferably human-made - there are undoubtedly students who can design in IIT and are willing to help out!)

# Lack of a IIT Student Study Area

There's apparently a "Student Hub" at Block 4 Level 7, but I haven't been (the one time I tried to go there, it was locked...) 

In addition, when I asked my careperson about it, it's apparently used by the IITSC students and is usually noisy. 

While the library exists, it's still nice to have a place just for IIT students to study. A good example would be Sprout for HSS.

That's all I can think of for now. Hopefully they will be able to engage the students better in both coming up with the syllabus and also about making day-to-day life at IIT better.

I don't think that students should be left out of what is being taught completely - especially since this is an industry where some of the students are more skilled than the lecturers and have an idea about what can be useful for a career in the industry. So yeah. I hope they can engage students better.

Would love to hear your opinions on this!
