Comment by NyandaKun: Hi there, here are all the list of eateries that are halal :
1. The flavors at the School of Info Tech (Level 2) - Muslim stall , western cuisine and ayam Penyet store 
2. Canteen (not the one near the convention centre) at Engineering block (level 2) - Muslim stall . I’m not sure about the western stall (please do let me know) 
3. McDonald’s , Subways
4. Bistro Lab - yes it’s halal.

Comment by smoneee: Whats itas? It bbt isit? Yes western is good affordable too

Comment by AdAdditional194: Used to be halal months ago then they had a closure. After the reopening, saw that it was no longer halal ‘certified’. Might be a certification issue or they change ingredients to not halal but your discretion.

Comment by NyandaKun: Not sure though . But do look out for the sign yea?

Comment by Ok-Mortgage-3178: bistro labs halal???
