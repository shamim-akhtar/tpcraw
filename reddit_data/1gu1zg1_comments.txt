Comment by Accomplished_Desk177: Hi. I received the email on the school fees. But not the bursary payout yet.

Comment by SnooCookies9235: the 2nd pay out is most likely gna come out in mid dec - start jan? sometimes they'll deduct sch fees first then aftwards send us our bursary so dont worry!

Comment by Vinhunter666: Yea , thatâ€™s the problem the bursary comes in slower than the school fees invoice. Before this there was a time post about this too but then someone said that the bursary wil offset the school fees amount. But the invoice nvr show

Comment by Accomplished_Desk177: Mabe check with the general office ?? I got PSEA so it will auto detuct the fees.

Comment by Vinhunter666: PSEA and bursary different
