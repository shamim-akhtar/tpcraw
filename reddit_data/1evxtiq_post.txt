Hey everyone, I'm posting on behalf of my group for a research project we're doing. It's a survey on **educational elitism in Singapore**, and how it would affect social cohesion and harmony. all responses will be **anonymous**.

Ngl, we chose this topic very deliberately since we noticed that even though it isn't obvious, there is a very palpable stigma around going into less prestigious schools/anything thats not a jc :( 

TP students who feel strongly about elitism and are kind enough to share their thoughts, please drop us a response! Please share this to your friends/family members too!
