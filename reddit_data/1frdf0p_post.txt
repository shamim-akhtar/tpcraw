Body: Hii I am a Y1S1 student in the school of business. I would like to ask:  
1. If theres a need for CCA's because of SEAL points or Resume padding  
2. How much SEAL Points should I go for to make sure it's good (University)  
3. I skipped out on CCA's this year as my careperson said that year 1 had the most weightage (idk) and I wanted to focus on my studies, so are there any concerns when joining a CCA next year? 

Thank you all for your time :))
