Comment by casper_07: They’re looking for mostly starter level players in the CCA, if u don’t have the skill to back it up, they’ll reject u even as a substitute player. U can try for sure, go there have some fun, never try never know all that and see for yourself if you’d like

Comment by iamnothingbuta: Tbf from previous comments they look for players with secondary school experience/ competition experience, so if you don't have it then ya
