Body: I got posted there and I've tried looking for comments on the course to learn more abt it but I can't find jack shit so if there r any students or alumni who could share more about it, that'd be great thx 🙏🙏
Like is it stressful? And what's the timetable roughly like? R there any unique and cool aspects to it? I only know that it's rlly versatile
Also I don't rlly get how the poly system works so I'd appreciate if y'all could elaborate on that 👨‍🦲 eg the lectures and classes and shii 

Oh and I heard there r uniforms for formal occasions but how often do we hv to wear them if that's true
And is there a specific dress code for biz students cz I wanna pull up to sch like a baddie

And how's the social life? Cz I'm not joining any ccas since I think it's a waste of time and I live an hour+ away from TP so I'll be insanely worn out by the time I come home 

Okay I'm done ty for hearing me out 🧑‍🦲🙏
