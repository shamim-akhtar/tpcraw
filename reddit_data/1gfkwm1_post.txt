Body: Hey everyone!

I’m looking into applying to TP, and I’ve got a ton of questions about CCAs—would love any insights you all can share!

1. How do CCAs actually work day-to-day? I’ve seen a lot about applying, but what’s it like once you’re in?
2. How do you usually find out about CCA events or meetings?
3. Why did you join your CCA, and are you enjoying it so far?
4. What kinds of events or activities does your CCA usually organize?
5. How often do you end up going to CCA events?
6. How do you all stay in touch? (Is it mostly through chat groups or something?)
7. What’s the commitment level like? Is it worth the time?
8. Are you expected to go to every meeting or session?
9. I’m kind of curious about the leadership skills thing—have you noticed any personal growth or new skills from joining?
10. How can you tell if you’re really building leadership skills through CCA stuff?
11. Also, can someone explain CCA points? I keep seeing posts about them, but I’m still confused. How do you earn points, and how do you know how many you have?

Thanks so much!
