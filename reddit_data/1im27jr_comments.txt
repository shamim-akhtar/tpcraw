Comment by TheoryPatient6067: We cant help u much but to tell u to just start wi the revision. I dont know what will be out fully too, but dont just stay here expecting for resources to come rushing in. Use what you have and be independent enough to self research. Like i dont understand what is the trend of students coming here, asking what to do to prepare. The topics are there.
