Body: Im not familiar with this, so appreciate for any help or advice. My daughter's 1st choice was IAD (T22) Interior Architecture and Design and 2nd choice was CDP (T71) for Common Design Programme. 

She got accepted for the 2nd choice (T71), but i read the course description that she can still go to T22 after 1 sem, is my understanding correct? are there any points or advise i should tell her ? thanks in advance for anyone who will answer.
