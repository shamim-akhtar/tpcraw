Comment by meop1: I said I would like to be considered for all available, including the TP scholarship. My y1s1  gpa is 3.85, but I don't have a portfolio. Am I supposed to have one?

Comment by meop1: hss. which sch r u from?

Comment by None: I have no portfolio at all like completely 0

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: for which one?

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: I’m sure there was at least a why should you be selected section which is meant for you to include any notable contributions and achievements,, 3.85 may be too low for tp scholarship without portfolio as I had friends who didn’t even get shortlisted with a 4.0 and no portfolio

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: i have applied also but didnt hear back. I also didnt include any portfolio :(((

Comment by ghost_editz: u expect to get scholarship without portfolio?

Comment by meop1: ohh so the achievements = portfolio? Then, I did include my contributions and achievements.

Comment by meop1: I got include...

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: Then it may not have been sufficient for this round of shortlisting,, you can always try again in the future sems
