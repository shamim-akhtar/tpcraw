Comment by damusuck: Boring, build websites 3 times and a crappy mobile app. Just use chatgpt and your brain to troubleshoot + ui design

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: alright thanks bro!

Comment by damusuck: Oh do pay attention to which TPFUN modules are actually graded. Didn’t realise Global studies was lol and my teacher was a piece of work. agile methodology design thinking(I think that’s its name) is pretty good, teaches you about SCRUM framework and AGILE methodology which companies actually use(albeit they don’t follow scrum 100% but take bits and pieces). There’s a certification for it that normally costs $150USD but you can get a discount for $50USD and get a refund if you pass(need to get like 80/90% I can’t remember)

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: ah yes! for our batch i think gs not graded only ecomms. AMDT we completed already in 2.1
