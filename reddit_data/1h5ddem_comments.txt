Comment by mount2010: Yup, completely agree, all my classmates are falling asleep and the stuff is mostly a repeat of COMT. I wrote to the SL about it and he responded with a chatgpt response -_-. Do write to him though, more feedback might actually get them to do something about it, if not for us then the next batch.

I hope they'll actually do our Y2 stuff properly so it might be good to feedback so they can work on that too.

Comment by Embarrassed-Bit-9300: Who is the SL these days?

Comment by yvonne1298_: im in one of his classes and his classes always ends 1 hour after the lesson starts.  first he recaps the alert quiz from prev lesson then plays a video. then proceeds to take a 10 min break before doing the chatgpt questions. at this point there is no point in attending the lessons anyway. but hes a chill guy ngl

Comment by mount2010: Mr. Lim Kok Yau
