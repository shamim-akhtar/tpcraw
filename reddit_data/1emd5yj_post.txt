Body: will tp kick me out if i fail math and finance by like 1-2 marks? i’m actually cooked and i don’t want to fail i actually really wanna study law but math and finance is actually my downfall
how strict are they in terms of kicking students out?
if it helps my attendance is 100% (the bar is so low)
