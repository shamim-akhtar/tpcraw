Body: Hellos! Providing guidance to students is something I am passionate about and I would like to contribute back to my juniors after receiving lots of guidance from seniors myself. I graduated from tp psych in 2023 and I'm currently in ntu psych y2 with offers from both ntu and nus + multiple scholarships back in 2023 (please do have some decency and **do not dox me** if you know me)

I am providing short/long-term consults/mentorships to any tp psych student (prospective/current/graduated) or really any poly student who may be interested (but I might not be the best at helping for specific matters if you're from a different course). I've met many students over the years and it has been fun :P my longest term one is still ongoing and they are currently in uni y1 on scholarship as well :)

These are some areas I can help you with:

1. Academics - I will **not** provide you with model answers or notes (there are many seniors out there who would be willing to), but I can guide you in areas you are unsure about
2. Portfolio - CCAs, external commitments and the whole deal
3. Uni admissions - write-ups, portfolio, process, interview, thinking about pathways and choice of uni, etc
4. EAE - write-ups, portfolio, interview, etc
5. Any other things you may wanna chat about!

If you're interested, you can book a consult to have a chat with me, I hope to see you soon :) [https://calendly.com/psychhelp/scams-are-everywhere](https://calendly.com/psychhelp/scams-are-everywhere)
