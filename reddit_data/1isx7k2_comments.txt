Comment by mount2010: The ADEV MCQ and closed response was doable lah, would dare even say easy (array indexing, for loops, even variable assignment var x = 15 + 20, what is x?). The two open ended questions (3 and 7 marks each) I can agree is difficult, probably to separate the As and the Bs.

The DBAV open ended required some join knowledge and knowledge of how the API boilerplate looks (but you should have revised this, so pure memorization).

Comment by DprsoYugen: instead of testing ADEV/DBAV, they are testing which students have photographic memories instead ðŸ¤£ see who can regurgitate it out the best, just for most students to forget about it 2 steps out of the exam room!

closed book.. truly unrealistic. Bunch of clowns running School of IIT.

Comment by hadessg: pure bs that there's no code editor lol

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Even as someone who can remembers content easily, the test was mad but expectedâ€¦ not sure if they have enough As to go around

Comment by pokkagreentea100: not sure if they have enough passes to go around to begin with.

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: There is. Dw
