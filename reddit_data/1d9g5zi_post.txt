Body: Have 2 roles open for intern:

MET (Medical Escort & Transport) Intern
Gym Tonic Intern
Starting Sep 2023

If your course allows you to take this intern as your graded intern, feel free to apply. Otherwise, mostly relevant for those in Diploma in Gerontology.

$800/month, organisation is an IPC and member of NCSS, based in the north. 

Let me know if keen, application closes late June.
