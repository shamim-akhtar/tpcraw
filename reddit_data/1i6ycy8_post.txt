Body: Hi fellow IIT students,

I do recognise this is very late (sorry, just realized that this would be useful for you guys -- I noticed many students not having red squiggly lines which would help them notice errors). Highly recommending that you install and use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to catch errors in your code. This will improve your code quality and help prevent some simple typo errors that you guys have encountered.

Subject Leader has approved this plugin.

Step 1:

open terminal

```
npm install --save-dev eslint @eslint/js
```


Step 2:

create a file called eslint.config.js in your project folder (main folder, above the static folder with all your js or whatever, it's where your db_connections.js is if you're following the Restaurant Review lab)

Step 3:

paste this in

Edit: this one will work for you guys, I am using a new version of Javascript for my project and not the one you guys were taught

    const js = require("@eslint/js")
    const globals = require("globals")

    module.exports = [
    	js.configs.recommended,

    	{
    		rules: {
    			"no-unused-vars": "warn",
    			"no-undef": "warn",
    		},
    		languageOptions: {
    			globals: {
    				...globals.browser,
    				...globals.node
    			}
    		}
    	}
    ]




Step 4: 

Install Eslint Plugin in Visual Studio Code. Go to extensions and search for Eslint and install.

Please help spread the word. Maybe we'll have to post about this next year for the next batch of IIT students as well :sweat_smile:

Edit: edited config to make it work for the most common student project setup

edit 2: make it clearer where to put the config file
