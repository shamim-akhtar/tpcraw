Body: From business school, final year doing fyp.
Grouped with sucks people cuz they got criteria in choosing people. (Total 4 of us)
I took the initiatives to schedule meetings, assigning tasks like research, planning the whole project.
End up, no research shared with me, meaningless discussions during meetings. 
1 can reply messages within 1 hour then the other 2 like happy go lucky, sometimes 24 hour then read.

Seriously had enough, I can tank and do the project. But should I report such issue? Will lecturers down grade their marks? What will u guys do?
