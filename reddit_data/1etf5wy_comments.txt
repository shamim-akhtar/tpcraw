Comment by iamnothingbuta: nect use cisco and aws

adev uses html css and sql

Ddev uses sql but it's connected to adev

Dsag is python

Comment by Altruistic_Hand3617: Y3 here. 
Network and Cloud Technology must be new so im not too sure.

If nothing has changed should be mysql for database and html css javascript for Application Dev Project. 
Both modules are related to one another unless there is any changes.

For data structures should be python

Comment by i_verye_smowt: NECT will be cisco packet tracer

DSAG is python (again) but you won't be making a game

ADEV and DBAV can be lumped into one module, ADEV focuses more on javascript and html, DBAV more on MySQL. For project 1 you'll make an sql database, project 2 will be some sort of website which is linked to a given sql database (not the one from project 1)

ofc some things are subject to change, so take this with a tiny grain of salt
