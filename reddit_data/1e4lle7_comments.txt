Comment by AlertYogurtcloset604: helloo!! im nt applying for vet tech but i did go over to their open house and asked what they wanted to see during eae so i'll js put it here briefly aights 

- aptitude test: knowledge abt the sector, mayb some questions about treatment  
- interview : REALLY SHOW ALOTTTT OF INTEREST, might ask some questions that judge ur morals as well since it's technically in the saving lives sector 

- other tips: mayb go online and find some vids and basic must knows or js go to tp website and find out some stuff pertaining to the modules and all loll
