Body: Just a small rant. I have been excelling since y1s1 but sem 2 is a total crashout moment. The As turned into Cs in the blink of an eye.

I feel as if I don't have the ability to perform well anymore. Want to secure my spot in director list too... Toh rlly. 

Not complaining about management team but just felt drained when I had friends getting straight As and I'm here not going all out for projects anymore. My projects are way too simplified and def not up to par for a better grade. 

I'm too lazy to compete with you guys anym haha. I hope you guys are still surviving
