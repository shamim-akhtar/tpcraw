Body: Hey everyone!

As Year 3 approaches, it's important to plan ahead, especially if you have commitments like a family vacation! I will be studying **Wafer Fabrication Process and Equipment Technology** as an elective module, and I have a few questions in mind. Since my family is also planning a vacation, I want to be sure about the academic schedule before confirming any dates.

Here are some things I'm thinking of asking:

**Breaks & Holidays** â€“ Are there any semester breaks or long weekends where traveling would be possible? 

To what I understand there is a 2 week holiday in June this year. Will we get called back during the holidays ?? If anyone have information do update in the comments section.

If anyone has taken this module before or has info on Year 3 schedules, let me know! Would love to hear your advice before reaching out to my lecturers.
