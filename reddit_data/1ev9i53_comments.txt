Comment by NyandaKun: It’s located at block 26A . The cluster that you are referring to is where you are being designated to seat on . For example , cluster 1 is your class , cluster 2 is other diploma classes . 

If you are coming from the main gate , you have to walk all the way to the end of the school of business building, turn left , enter the door on the left at auditorium 3 , walk straight, turn right and turn left till you see an elevator and that’s where the sports hall is . 

If you are coming from the East Gate, you would have to walk from the School of Humanities, and you should notice a building straight saying “sports and art centre , 26A” . Take the lift up to the sports hall (there’s a sign on the lift) .

Comment by NyandaKun: One more thing, good luck for your exam !
