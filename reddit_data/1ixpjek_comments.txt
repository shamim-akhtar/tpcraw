Comment by nothappygooutside: i believe you would have to withdraw from
your current full-time course and apply for the part-time course next year. however, you should note that some part-time courses require work experience to get in. do check the requirements for admission of part-time courses in TP before withdrawing.

Comment by Which_Action_5554: Perhaps speak with your current CP about it first ?
