Body: hi uh i feel rather anxious about internship and post poly life um I didn’t do too well in my first year and i want to go to local u but does local uni application only care about gpa or are there other options if my gpa is not at the current standard i have a good portfolio and i did well for my o’s it’s just my current cgpa which is holding me down… any tips from fellow students would appreciate it man
