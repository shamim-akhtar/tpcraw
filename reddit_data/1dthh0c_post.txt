Body: I am currently in my last year of ECDE in TP about to graduate soon and I really dislike this course. I only joined because I didn’t know what I wanted to do. Now, I know what I want but I heard it’s not possible/going to be difficult to change the field of study. 

If it’s possible, what are some things I can do outside of school to be considered for the degrees I mentioned above? 

If it’s not possible, is there any other things I can do to make it possible? 

I really don’t want to be stuck in ECDE for the rest of my life.
