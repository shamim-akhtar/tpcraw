Body: im gg to pfp@tp in cbp course and i just want to know how the day to day is like? I live all the way in the west and honestly, im more afraid of getting burnt out from the travel compared to the workload(which i heard is a LOT). 

anyways, is it more laxed like 3 days of sch a week or 5 days of school everyday? Im planning to join a cca so i just wanted some insight!!

btw i have more questions on my previous post if you guys would like to answer

THANK YOU!
