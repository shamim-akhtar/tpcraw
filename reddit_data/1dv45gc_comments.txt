Comment by definitelytroaxx: u need to wear dri fit pants and shirt, sports shoe and mini towel. dn to book but u need matrix card and do the gym test thingy before they allow u to enter

Comment by Baxtonwarls: Just wear something thatâ€™s considered sporty, eg no jeans or chino pants. Also note BRING A TOWEL. You will not be able to enter without a towel. Hope this helps

Comment by Drdeeznutsonyourface: Wait does the gym sonetime closes for cca?

Comment by Drdeeznutsonyourface: I see thanks! Do you perhaps know of any timing when the gym is not crowded?ðŸ˜…

Comment by definitelytroaxx: ya will close after 6pm mon-thurs, fri after 5pm for cca

Comment by Baxtonwarls: I donâ€™t go there too often but you can almost always find a empty rack so just go whenever youâ€™ve got the time. It doesnâ€™t get too crowded from my experience and I always go during lunch
