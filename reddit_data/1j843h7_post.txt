Body: I have heard of some things in poly that is different from secondary school. That includes having weird if not bizarre or interesting CCAs ever like Japanese club (hearing it being the most weird people there), Business studies club, life saving etc. So I'm just curious to ask, what is the weirdest or the most interesting CCA in your opinion?
