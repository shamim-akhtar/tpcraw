Comment by Runningstride: That’s because the JC folks are now in poly. 

It’s extremely hard to do well if you aren’t clever.

Comment by grandmasterlau: Perhaps the credit requirements have gotten more demanding over the years? 

Was from TP Eng school last time. Life was pretty chill in the sense that under the FAST system, we could choose our own core and elective modules and hence our timetable. I remember not coming to campus at all on 1 of the weekdays, so basically just 4 days a week. The downside was in order to cram into 4 days, some days are longer and you have absurd breaks in-between on 1 or 2 days. Like after a lecture on 2pm and the next one is 5pm. I think there are more projects these days though.

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: To pass is chill.

To progress to uni is not.

Comment by alts013: Poly is a marathon if u want to go to uni. Consistent high grades from y1s1 to maintain cGPA of >3.4. JC is a single point failure event. Pick your poison.

Comment by NyandaKun: I would say that polytechnics being a chill institution is NOT ALWAYS true and here's my reason: 

\[The following things I am going to say may be triggering! please take it with a pinch of salt\]

>!1. Being in the life in poly is really competitive where people are just competing with other people in their GPA to get to university. I have seen instances like in business and science schools and it really create the atmosphere of the school environment to rather have that stigma around students to compete with one another. I have seen instances where in group project, they would have grivance on that particular person because of his academic performance and therefore not want to work with that person, which extends to the point that it makes school a competition rather than sociable and fun. Compared to other tertiary institution like ITE, the approach to how polytechnic being set is just TOO MUCH and it kind of having people to create a sense of social deduction among one another on who to trust. !<

>!2. The content that are being taught is way more advanced that what is normally expected . For example, in my experience in the applied science, when I first studied principles of inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry, I initially thought that the content would be like 100% similar to what I was being taught in ITE but it is way advanced that I need to do a decent amount of updates on my theory. And not to forget, that in polytechnic compared to ITE, it is really a mixed of theory and practical so if you are very weak in theory, you would definitely have a harder time juggling with other modules of similar difficulty and that is what makes it harder than my life in ITE where 60% is practical based and 30% is theory based. !<

>!3. The commitment to the polytechnic life is just really too much that I would say that you don't have some time for self care. Committing to the polytechnic life means having to go to cca to boost your portfolio, work on project and then normal study.  Before coming to polytechnic and in my life in ITE, I have plenty of time for self-care despite I have like many modules with just me having to study as per normal. I can do self care like playing genshin impact, league of legends and etc. But now because of projects and so many things going on, I don't have that amount of self care but rather reduced, so much so that I don't have time to play games or even enjoy many games because there are so many games that have been released after the year 2020 where like the pandemic go booming and then the games are developed to cope with people's mood. Games like Zenless Zone Zero, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves, Hogwart Legacy are like the trending games in the market and honestly I wanted to play all of the games but yeah, poly life is just so detrimental to my mental health and my energy level. !<

  
Overall, we cannot assume that after we leave secondary school to a skill-based tertiary institution e.g. Laselle, ITE, Poly, we get the most freedom out of it because the goal for the institution regardless to build up on both our technical skills and soft skills e.g. communication, personal values and entrepreneurship. We all are from different diplomas and we have our own pros and cons in our diploma, so judging different diploma based on how difficult the content is just illogical because at the end, the person who is weak in their academics but has the interest in that particular industry would pass rather than a person who is academically strong but has lack of interest. Determination is key to a successful life in the academics and do not lose the opportunity that you have been given, even if you may not like the course or you feel like certain modules does not benefit you in life. We all have our stories to write, to experience and judge how we view our lives in poly. Just like in the telltale game called the Walking Dead, your choices in whatever you do would determine your fate and change the events. 

Before I end my message here, I would like to share a bit of a story just for all of you who think if your life in polytechnic sucks or great. 

In my life in the institution in both ITE and Poly, I have seen many instances of people who are academically weak, who intentionally come late to class, and worst,  just wanting to give up in their academic life and withdraw from the academics. Some is due to mental well being, others just don't want to study anymore and just want to have more freedom in their life, while they said that coming to school is meaningless to him or her. I have seen some of these people, trying to come to school to learn and make friends, and graduate with a smile. But there are some who really cannot do it and just quit. I am one of them that I just wanted to avoid school and self-study because I live at the north-west and TP or ITE is at the Tampines/Simei. But what makes me want to come to school is not about the school life or just wanting to make friends and be like a normal typical student like a stereotypical barbie in a movie. It is about me, making improvements for myself, both my personality and my professionalism. In ITE, I learnt how to take risks and as the nike slogan goes , JUST DO IT! At the same time, I am also improving my mental wellbeing due to the pandemic. In poly right now, as I am mentoring the younger generation while building up my professionalism, I learnt how to be a leader to be there for everyone, while at the same time, building my tolerance with people as I am very anti-social. In life, you cannot stop yourself from learning and make a checkpoint to say that you have reached the checkpoint, you would have to make yourself a better you to catch up with the trends in the market and to be able to make your life more "chill". Life's not chill if you don't do anything to make yourself chill. 

I wish you all the  best in your endeavours!

Comment by Commercial_War_2969: by reading this i know you’ve never been to a design course before & certainly haven’t seen enough of design. if you think design is “chill”, trust me you haven’t seen enough. let’s take tp design courses as an example. most of us have 9am to 6pm classes, 5 days a week. we have submissions VERY frequently and they can’t be rushed last minute. most of us actually have to stay back after school up till 10+pm to continue working on our projects. i’m not saying other schools and anybody isn’t having it tough but i also didn’t really like how you compared it to design as a “chill” school. i know you don’t mean it in any bad ways but i just wanted to let you know, this is the reality of design. you’d see ppl having mental breakdowns because submissions can get so tight that most of us survive on 0 sleep only to get a msg grade. i’d say design sch ppl tend to be more hype in a way that’s why we may look like we have a vibrant life but i’m convinced we are all just trying to hype ourselves us to keep us going if not it’ll be exceptionally depressing. i’ve a lot more i can say about the not so nice side of design but i hope this also helps u understand better. even during holidays we also have to work on projects.

Comment by theuselessmastermind: poly life hasn't been chill for a while lol esp for harder courses. i still think it's "chill" in a sense compared to JC life tho

Comment by blackrosethorn3: Grad from ASC, school was not chill but I wasn't mugging every waking hour. I had time to hang out and have some social life while still studying and doing cca stuff. More like chill compared to JC but not chill enough to slack off

Comment by None: [removed]

Comment by Latter_Special655: omg agreed!!!! im from IT course and i can tell u that poly life is NOT CHILL especially entering year 2 life is tough grind is real sleep is precious and no where to be found especially during assignment periods, and trying to get a cgpa of 3.0 alone is already tough af (for me personally) im struggling and i already have 100000 instances where i want to dropout but i keep on telling myself to just suck it up and go on for another 1.5 years

Comment by zoedian: Would argue that the more conceptual modules are of equivalent level to uni, there's really no way to ensure fair grading qualitatively across all institute for the same context

Comment by Easy-Vermicelli3317: Have you enrolled in a design course before?

Comment by throwaway1111xxo: Was once made to cut 100 pieces of cardboard. Fuck that.

Comment by BDOPenitencia: idk i was from computer engineering and it was pretty chill, as long as u bothered to do ur coursework with reasonable quality, it's pretty easy to get into uni.

only the mods with exams u need to watch out for. but each semester maybe 1 max 2? (except for y1 where they have exams on all the foundation mods)

but otherwise if u don't join any cca and don't attend any lectures(just go self study and read ahead) it will b v chill

personally, i just did my work to reasonable quality, all the mods with exam i scored a B to B+ (emath1, emath2)
flunked the useless mods(global studies 1 and 2 scored a C and B respectively) and still managed to get a 3.7+ and get into NTU computer engineering 

i think bottom line is to just care about ur results. don't be like the 1 dumbass in my class who hasn't even started the project on the day of the submission.

and ask ur profs for help, usually if u poke them enough they will just straight up give u answers for ur project

Comment by incognitodw: Because in the past, people choose poly just because they want to chill. Nowadays, more people purposely choose poly becos they know they can to do well and have an edge in Uni. Times have changed. 

U can still chill if you want to just pass. Don't care about what other people do

Comment by Nearby_Resource_9856: no way bro said design is chill 💀 design is mostly doing drafts > getting critique > improve design > rinse and repeat until draft gets approved. this causes most, if not all, design students to stay up late frequently just to complete their submissions. 

not to mention that design/art is subjective, meaning that there is no right or wrong answers when it comes to grading. no matter how well u think ur design is, if the lect doesn’t feel that it’s nice or applying what u’ve learnt, u will auto get a low grade. 

please do not undermine what design students go through

Comment by kaleidostar11: Depends on perspective of the individual, you have ppl with diverse backgrounds joining poly. The secondary school grind for some ppl from elite schools are pretty insane compared to poly IT/Eng. But yeah, in general business and design courses are more "chill".

Comment by dtunerz: Well it isn't unless u have a goal in my of what you wanna do and why you're in poly. If u just wanna get your diploma cert then maybe a just pass will do but if u wanna work hard towards a uni life then u gotta grind and hustle hard. That's the thing I noticed when I was in TP then

Comment by raeraesbaebae: as a design student, i can assure you all the stereotype of design students having it 'easier' is certainly not true. this applies to most of my friends in design as well. even though we just finished y1s1, the workload for the first semester is much more than you would expect. well yes, the first two weeks was chill and all. but once all the learning really starts, we have a lot to absorb. indeed, we don't have written exams like other courses. but it doesn't mean we have more time for ourselves. if anything, we probably sleep less than the rest of the courses. we have at least 2 to 3 submissions for a module per semester so far - and we have 6 modules, not inclusive of tpfun. the submissions are the most intense in the last two weeks of the semester. many of us have to balance our assignments and ccas, leaving nearly no time for our personal life - at least for me. to be frank, many of us sleep for less than three hours a day for the two weeks. we don't study, we don't grind - not because we don't need, but we can't. coursework needs constant effort and a lot of time especially if you're a perfectionist like myself. and design is subjective so we wouldn't know exactly our assignments should turn out. we don't have answer keys, we don't have model answers. yes, some people find design more chill but some don't. i'm pretty sure that there are people who have it easier or harder than myself but this is just from my perspective. 

in a nutshell, no poly course is easy because everyone's definition of 'hard' is different. it's your choice to choose your 'hard'! it's important for us to continue motivating ourselves to improve from who we are yesterday. good luck for poly everyone :D

Comment by Puzzleheaded_Chaoz: I am millennial and was doing information tech. During my time there were alot of assignment form 2nd year onwards and some were group work and guess what the ladies (I am a lady too) NOT really into hands on technical project (but excel in memorising the theory), I end up doing a lot of work. So be careful who you choose to work with (don fall into peer pressure trap)

Comment by Small-Ad-5448: I had the best life in Poly.
Chill around. Dated around. I went to campus in morning and work in the evening.
GPA 3.7. Good enough for me.

Got offered a course in NUS too, but I chose to join NIE instead.

Comment by AccountantOpening988: Depends what you mean by chill. Institutions are not discos and bars, lol.

Comment by yzf02100304: I studied biomedical in RP from 2014 to 2016. It’s quite chill tbh. I had time going gym and play the violin.

Comment by Financial-Job794: Your post makes my blood boil. Don’t go comparing courses based on what you’ve 'seen.' I doubt you even understand what we go through in design. Every course has its own difficulties. In design school, we have back to back assignments from the start until the end of the semester, often with little to no sleep. Just because you have to study and sit for exams in your 'science-y' course doesn’t mean design students have it easy. If you think your course is hard, why don’t you drop out and try design school for yourself? I’m sure you’ll find it 'easy' too. Why compare courses?

Comment by Otherwise_Reaction75: Hahah.... y1, exam week is 3 weeks (ending on 1/9) but mine ended last week, add on holiday, I have nearly 2months+ of holiday...

Add on the fact last sem, Mondays is full on BL, and Fridays there's no class.... 

But projects are rlly scary sometimes 😱😱

Comment by AlertMaintenance2361: The fuck. Poly is super chill you strawberries

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: Studied law here, graduated with stellar grades. If you wanna do well, obviously you have to dedicate  time and effort in your studies. Despite that i still thought it was quite chill. The things that are not chill are the retards that I have been paired with during group projects. Still managed to make it out regardless outperforming 95% of my cohort.

Comment by None: Come to rp

Comment by nasigorengmama: as long as u do ur assignments, projects + scoring 60s to 70s in ur exams, its quite easy to get a cgpa 3.0. this is my definition of chill to me.

if u wanna go to NTU/NUS, u gotta hustle because its extremely competitive. 

to me, as long as u get a cgpa 3.0 and above, u have a good chance of entering the local unis other than NTU/NUS. 

personally, i got a cgpa 3.0 and got into SIT. no cca/achievements. 
others i know, got accepted into SIT/SUTD, with a cgpa of 2.8. 

but ofc, there are some who got rejected also. 

all in all, a higher cgpa will be the best but dont be so stressed out. my poly days were so chill & i still managed to get into uni. im pretty sure u will do fine

Comment by Glum-Trip7191: Omg being a poly kid before , what you said is 100% true

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: thanks so much for your insights!

Comment by NyandaKun: Well said mate! That’s a good point to say that we shouldn’t be judging other schools based on their appearance or the way they act externally.

Comment by noownoow: You kind of have a point about design students. I'm a design student, and I can tell you, I've received the culture shock of my life after graduating from ite.

Frequent submissions and assignments are one thing, but staying till nighttime is pretty wild. (As something I've subsequently would do that too, given if submissions are like 1-2 days away) I don't want to sound like I'm disregarding about people having to stay late for submissions, but it's something that is pretty new and it's a culture shock for me as it's something I wouldn't see many people do back in ite.

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: Not really. JC is a one time event. Poly is consistent stress since everything under the sun is graded

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: agreed!

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: haha!

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: omggg u got this atb!!! i just started doing law and i’m scared alr 💀

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: You from np?

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: no, but then again if you’re in any way offended or triggered, i did not intend to shit on any academic school, i’m simply just stating what i’ve heard and seen

Comment by Screwdriver_double: Was rejected to design school just bcoz of English. Did engineering instead. In working life, switched to IT. Then pursued Business for postgraduate.

Realised later in work life that those designers working for exhibition booths, posters and collaterals, or interior design will always be at the expense of people who want design changes again and again.

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: agree with everything you said, thanks for sharing!

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: you have me mistaken, i did not at all intend to shade on any academic schools, i’m only stating on what i’ve heard from seniors and friends. i’m a y1 student myself so please excuse me as i definitely know less than the more experienced. my apologies if any part of the post offended you.

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: and for the record, i would wholeheartedly drop out and join a design school if i could, please look at my other post if you haven’t. again my intention is not and never was to SHADE ANYONE OR ANY PERSON.

Comment by None: 🤣🤣🤣 i second that. its p chill since its open book exam

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: Ok I have to disagree w this.

3.0 is decent by all means.

But for a realistic chance to enter any local unis, 3.50 is the bare minimum. Maybe SUSS is less stringent with a below 3.50, but just hitting three won’t do you any wonders. 

There’s a good list of 3.30s getting rejected from recent years. And chances are it’ll only get more competitive. Maybe in a couple of years, 3.50 won’t even guaranteed a spot there.

Comment by theuselessmastermind: i'm not only talking about grading when i say chill. and banking everything on a one time event is pretty worse to me compared to being able to improve or deprove over time

Comment by Latter_Special655: hahaha thxs!! jiayous to u too!!!

Comment by Latter_Special655: tp

Comment by iamkhairi: You are sorely mistaken to think design school is chill and relaxed. It's the total opposite of chill

Comment by Different_Ad9756: SIT will accept relatively low GPAs as long as you are doing something else worthwhile with your time.

I know plenty of people with <2.5 GPAs but get into their course because they spend their time on hobbies(like 3d printing into a engineering course for example) or strong portfolio.

So if you are really passionate about something, they will accept you

Comment by millmounty: Second this, I'm a SIT student snd the content we cover is NOWHERE close to the content NUS/NTU students have the opportunity to cover.

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: You mess up one module and don't get cgpa 3.8+, don't dream of getting into NTU/NUS/SMU without good portfolio

Comment by passawayisgood: hor

Comment by theuselessmastermind: i don't think of that as end of the world so it's really not that "unchill" to me... and agn i'm not just talking grades wise i said JC life. i'm in arguably the most stressful sem of my life in an extremely difficult course and i still have it better than JC students

Comment by Iridiumstuffs: Nahhhh, I fucked up my Y1 S1 with a C for a 6CU mod. Still managed to get overall 3.84 and went to nus just fine

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: Come from JC and poly. 

I guess my JC life was rubbish because covid, but it was mostly how driven and how much you want 90rp

Poly is way more stress than JC, I fail my mid years in JC Is just talk to the teacher only, not my gpa tank
