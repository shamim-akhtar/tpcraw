Comment by Standard_Dragonfly15: real im super clueless rn

Comment by d3ckburpz: is it a huge reliance of whether they put you up for interview? or just a side statistic

Comment by LividOrdinary9644: same :(

Comment by Distinct-Bus-3041: Hii I’m having my aptitude test this Friday for TP AVM. Is there anything I should look out for?

Comment by d3ckburpz: what’s workers? and are you talking about the pre test sample or the actual, because the actions and reaction forces and cutting sanding allat is in the sample

Comment by Standard_Dragonfly15: oh what isnt the last qn cutting sanding polishing then painting

Comment by complexitiesof: i’m not sure if it will completely decide if you get the interview, but it’s definitely important. how you do will be compared to others who went through the test too, so doing well will just put you in a better position for the interview. this is just what i’ve heard from my snrs, so take it with a pinch of salt 😅

Comment by Apprehensive-Trip667: hi i would say look out for the time 30qn in 20min is very fast so if your unsure of a question just pit smth down and skip it focus on completing it with a decent accuracy.
