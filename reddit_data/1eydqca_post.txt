Body: i’ve seen countless people telling me that poly life is chill and don’t need to study so much. personally i feel it depends on the course you take. 

for example, compare a design student and a biomed student. obviously the design student is going to have a more vibrant life and a more “chill” time in poly as majority of their course is coursework based, and the design calendar’s holidays are a lot compared to other academic schools, such as engineering or business. on the other hand, the people taking science-y courses or other courses such as law need to study a lot, as these courses are super academic driven. 

so i feel the perception of poly life being “chill” is subjective, as different people in different courses may have either a super rigorous curriculum or be on holiday for like almost half the year. 😂 (not shading). 

does anyone else feel the same way?
