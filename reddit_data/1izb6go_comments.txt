Comment by ReplyAdventurous3235: hi , I have just finished my first year in this course. 

You can research on tp website on what to learn .

[ABS](https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/students/schools/eng/architectural-technology-building-services.html)

If the good thing you can put in this way is that this course it will be a key to professions in the Built Environment like architects , interior design  and engineering and so much more. 

In terms of job prospects, is that this diploma allows you to be in professions said above .
( it is also stated in the website )

You will expect to learn subjects relating to built environment which is like what are the regulations for constructing a building like electrical design , Digital modelling etc.
There are subjects that exercise your critical thinking like math, physics , coding etc.

I know that what I have mentioned about the subjects might be daunting to you but the important thing is to have an open mind in poly and embrace the changes .

I have enjoyed my first year so far with the right group of friends and my classmates. 

There will be times when the workload would be tough, but on the flip side , there would be classmates and lecturers to help you .

It is all on your perseverance, willingness to strive to do your best, and grit.

Hope this helps  and all the best to your upcoming sch year !!
