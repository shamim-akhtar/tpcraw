Comment by None: old stories from back when i was a design student. 

1) the reason why design school is always so haunted is because back when the school first open, a group of students went to draw a summoning circle. i think they actually summoned something got scared and ran off WITHOUT closing the circle so design school is haunted. (personally at night it feels eerie but haunted? that i can't say for sure)

2) my senior told me this. he used to stay in the studio late to work on stuff. but pass 8pm strange things will happen like penknife disappearing or stuff disappearing. they named this ghost/spirit xiao ming. when they realise this happen (disappearance of staionary) they would go to the supermarket and buy sweets to leave as offering. then their stationaries will come back. 

3) the reason why the mannequinns in the design school are chained is because the mannequins come to life during 7th month. (personally i think it is just to prevent people from stealing it.)

Comment by Samui_Sam: Iâ€™m from the group that moved from Stirling Road campus to Tampines. Left in 1996.

Never heard or encountered anything. If anything we used to secretly stay in the Stirling Road campus too. 

Never heard, saw, smelled, tasted, or felt anything.
