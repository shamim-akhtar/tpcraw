Comment by pokkagreentea100: unlikely that they can switch for you unless you put comm design as one of your choices for EAE. guess you have to focus on JAE.

Comment by InterestingCity3361: Not possible to switch course. Probably focus on your  olvl to make the cut. EAE for design course are strong competition ðŸ˜¬

Comment by Tasty_Echidna7126: i put comm design as my 3rd choice for my eae, shld i bring it up during my interview or wld it lower my chances of getting into product experience and design?

Comment by pokkagreentea100: you should just bring it up during your interview.

Comment by Tasty_Echidna7126: thank you so much for your help!

Comment by Hot_Path_1438: hi wld like to help if its not too late? some courses especially comm design is incredibly competitive in EAE and sometimes the course chair will only select ppl who put comm des in first choice as it shows passion (for eg IAD only selects first choice students and ignores even second choice) im not saying you shouldnt mention it in your interview but i dont think it would help? seeing as they would be lecturers from PED and not CMD good luck! (ped is our smallest course and q hard to get into too due to limited slots so do what u will with that info!) feel free to hmu if u got more qns

Comment by pokkagreentea100: PED takes in about 40 in total and max 20 students from EAE due to its special case of 50% allowance from EAE. 

definitely mentioning during the interview may spark something, but it doesn't mean they would have a definite chance of getting in or even be shortlisted. 

But the least OP can do is to be honest.
