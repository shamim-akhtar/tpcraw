Body: Hello, any peeps studying aviation management currently? I saw on tp website which shows engineering math 1 & 2. Can I know how it's like? Coming from higher nitec in sports management, I have not touch math for 3 years already. Any take on it?

Also what happens if you fail the module? Will you be removed from the course?
