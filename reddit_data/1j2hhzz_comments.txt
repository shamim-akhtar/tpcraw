Comment by strwberri111: ehh nobody said anyt to the cher in charge or report regarding their behaviour? if they r like that, will be quite concerning sia if they went along wif the trip

Comment by Current-Material-339: If someone has the audacity to ask many girls the same question what all of you girls are doing. 
This is sexual harassment you should be reporting it. 
Accepting such thing will not make you a saint, or look cool/trendy/modern on contrary it is more selfish or cowardice. 
One by one individually file a complain to your care person. Don't go as a group. But make sure all of you file a report.
Such people should be reformed or punished.
