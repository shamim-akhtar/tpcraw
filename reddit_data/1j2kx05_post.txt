Body: Hi guys so I just wanna thank two kind souls who accompanied me to find the classroom for my exam today at the engineering block :D Big thanks to both of you and y'all really made my day!! I didn't managed to ask for your contact details to express my thanks cause was rushing for the exam but anyways just so thankful for y'all! if not for your help, i think I would have been really lost and late for exam today, and really miserable, so thank you so much ðŸ«¶

for some context I reached around 15 mins before my exam and was panicking while rushing to find the classroom where my exam was held so I went to the school of engineering trying to see if there's anyone I can ask for help on directions...i'm actually just a part-time diploma student so wasn't really familiar with campus and also not an engineering student. then I saw these two kind students at the canteen and decided to ask them. the first time I asked, they told me they are also not engineering students and didn't really know where I'm heading, so I thanked them and continued walking to the other side of the block thinking it's probably the other block (turns out i was walking to the design block which I heard from them which was totally wrong hahaha) and didn't find so went back, then they saw me and I decided to ask them again and showed some pictures that I have of the block. I think the pictures helped and they knew where I was going so they really went out of their way to take the lift and walk with me until I found the classroom, and when we reached they also wished me all the best for the exam ðŸ¥¹ðŸ˜­ from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for your help! also wishing y'all all the best for your studies (i understand that y'all are full-time students so jiayous!!) A little kindness goes a long way, and y'all have made a super huge difference to my day, thank you so much ðŸŽ‰ idk if y'all will see this but i hope so and just want to express my thanks here, thank you!
