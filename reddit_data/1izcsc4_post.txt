Body: For context I finished o level last year and have been admitted to aerospace engineering for 2025 . During my holiday last year I looked at tpâ€™s pld requirements and saw that MacBooks could be used for aerospace engineering although not the best choice. So I decided to buy a brand new MacBook Pro for school ,only to check the requirements this year to find it listed as not recommended. Will the lecturer force me to by a windows laptop or will they close a blind eye.
