Body: HEY GUYS😭
So i have recebtly applied for the MOE tuition grant but i misread one of the segments and placed my current course as my previous course. Everything else on the tuition grant option form should be correct though.  I have emailed TP about the issue but i still havent gotten anything back from them.

 What do i do?🥲

Any help would be appreciated!!!
