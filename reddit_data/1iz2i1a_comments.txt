Comment by nothappygooutside: i will highly discourage getting any device that uses iOS. as a business student you will rely on microsoft 365 very often and everyone knows that using microsoft 365 on iOS is a pain, this is especially so during BTA. during BTA, you will not be able to follow the tutorial because performing functions on microsoft 365 apps on windows compared to iOS is different. the demonstrations are always shown on a windows device, so students using iOS devices need 1-1 guidance. 

that being said, some students have both an iPad for taking down notes/scribbling while they use a Windows laptop for their main assignments, labs and tutorials. i think this is the most efficient way but of course it's your choice and you should choose whatever works for u! :)

Comment by Which_Action_5554: Welcome to TP family. 

There is a prescribed list of devices for you all to choose from.
These devices are course specific as it best suits course needs.

Recommended to follow and get accordingly.
