Comment by jasminebubblegum: no it doesnt, for common programmes its usually looking at your sem 1 results if im not wrong

Comment by Famous_Inspector_687: Technically attendance warning letters alone wonâ€™t impede your course progression unless your attendance is below 85% for Pass/Fail subs, which would cause you to retake the subject in the next semester. I got almost 20 warning letters of all kinds (academic, first/second attendance warning) but managed to complete the course too.
