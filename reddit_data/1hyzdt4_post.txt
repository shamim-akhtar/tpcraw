Body: Hello ☺! I'm going to enter TP ENG this yr in April. I EAE into IFM and was hoping anyone has any advice for me. I'm super excited to be in poly but super not excited to have to take Engineering math. How to make a good impression on orientation week? How is the work-load? How's the lecturers ? Basically any piece of knowledge you have I want. Thank you 🙏🌹❤
