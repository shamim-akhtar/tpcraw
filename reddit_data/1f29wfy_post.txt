Body: I took the Igcse (Edexcel) in May-June series. Here are my grades. I only got grade 3 in Eng Language B.
For some reasons, I can't retake exam in Oct Nov. That's why I have to apply with this grade. I planned to apply IT or civil engineering course in the following intake. Do I have chance of being acceptedðŸ˜¢.
