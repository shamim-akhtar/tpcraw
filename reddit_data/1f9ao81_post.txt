Body: ok so like iâ€™m y1 and in iit. at first i wanted to go to business but then my dad said oh hard to go uni hard to get job super competitive and vague course. so he told me go iit and i was like tsk ok fine whatever because he kept pestering me right. and i was like sure fine ok bcuz iâ€™ve alw wanted to know how to code and all

but like 1st semester done, im half cooked half not. comt was a disaster. allat. and like genuinely i wanna be good at this stuff and i think its q cool and kinda fun if i know what im doing but i feel like im lacking behind so much. all my friends talk abt idk whatever servers and im like ?? what.. like i feel like im js not the typical iit student whoâ€™s all like ðŸ¤“ðŸ‘† and idk i feel so lost bcuz im so new. like yeah i have friends who also dh coding backgrounds but some of them pick it up so fast as if they do before like what.. am i js stupid or.. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
