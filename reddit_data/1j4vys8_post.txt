Body: Hi, just wanted to know if the computer engineering course has notes or materials that the  professors would expect us to access online. 
I am thinking of buying a cheap tablet to read class materials and to complete my work when I'm travelling. I find that my phone screen is way too small for this purpose.
Thank you!
