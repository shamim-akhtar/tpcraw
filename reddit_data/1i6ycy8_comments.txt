Comment by mount2010: btw, another plugin that would help a lot for JS projects is prettier, but it will edit your code to format it so make a backup of your code/use git (seriously, why do they not teach git?) before using it

this was also approved by the SL

might help other Information Technology students who will be doing more js in y2

Comment by mount2010: if you used this already please check the updated config so that it doesn't give you "window is not defined errors"

eslint updated and changed it's config file format so it's confusing :sweat_smile:

Comment by mount2010: edit: the config file wouldn't work for your projects because I am using a newer version of Javascript, updated to use your version
