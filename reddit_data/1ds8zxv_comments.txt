Comment by aminlee9: Shld have arrived by now. Mine came in tdy (albeit was shocked that it was half the amount). 

Weird that they broke the distribution into two batches spread out across the year. Must be because many applied for it this year.. o wells..

Comment by Vinhunter666: Last year was around this time, maybe this year too many people, so the process is much stricter and they might be more stingy and give you guys less. Check your tposs if the bursary is approved also.
