Body: quick question: i might have to submit an assignment one day late, and they say they'll take off 10% of the grade. but does rhat mean they'll take 10% off the max grade (e.g. if the assignment is max 60, you can only get 54) or do they take your score and minus 10% (e.g. if you score 30/50 they'll take that and minus 10% so u get 27/50)?
