Comment by None: 
OHHH! i thought it was polyclinic cause someone said to me HAHHAHA but thanks for the info! also can i ask, did they give a list of clinics can go to or any private clinic will do?

Comment by damond_27: Just go to any local clinic near your house and bring the medical report along and ask the person at the counter if they can run the tests. Most likely, they will say okay because all the tests are pretty simple. You will get your medical report filled up by the doctor within 30 minutes.

Comment by gisa_As748: i am in pfp and i joined common sci :]

Comment by Valuable_Image1098: omg so lucky!! im im common engineering 😅

Comment by Valuable_Image1098: ahh okay

Comment by brillianthues69: ouhhh i didn't know yalls had to do a colour vision test for engineering 😮😮 one of my friends is in veterinary tech i think she also has health tests to do

Comment by damond_27: Yeap has to be a physical copy as it is easier for the nurses and doctor there to fill up your details! Also, if you want, you can start by taking a picture of yourself for your ezlink card and matriculation card. Make sure you look good in the picture as it will be with you for 3 years unless you misplaced it. (Passport size photo with a preferably white background, or you can just edit it yourself)

Comment by Valuable_Image1098: okay ty! will there be a link for me to submit the forms back to tp or do i email them?

Comment by damond_27: They will give you a link to submit all your necessary documents like medical report, picture and parent and guardian consent form, etc. Also I received it on 25th February last year so don't worry, it should be anytime soon.

Comment by Valuable_Image1098: okay thank u sm for ur help 🙏🏻 what course r u in?

Comment by damond_27: Common science programme
