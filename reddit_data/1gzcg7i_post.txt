Body: yo chat so

  
I'm not sure where else this ad got placed, but IIT school block 3 lvl 3 had a flyer for model casting and I was like? hmm maybe okay can so I scanned the QR code and one of the questions was are you size XS-S... and there was a requirement for females to bring heels for the casting.

  
I'm like the FURTHEST thing from an S and I don't own heels (+ no money/not that willing to buy) but i am interested in the casting, should I still try?? Also they want a full body picture front + back and for us to wear snug/"form fitting" clothing for the casting and i guess i understand but should i really try?
