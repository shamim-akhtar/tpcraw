Comment by aminlee9: they will use the second part of the bursary to offset any payable amount for the second semester. 

source: I emailed them.

Comment by SnooCookies9235: the 2nd pay out is most likely gna come out in mid dec - start jan! they'll most likely deduct sch fees first then aftwards send us our bursary so dont worry :)

Comment by Confident-Beat2718: Is that absolute or depends if we pay for our semester? Like for EG we pay via CPF/GIRO, they gonna use our bursary to offset first than use our preferred payment method to pay for the remaining amount?

Comment by aminlee9: Yea most likely they will offset first and any remainder amount will be credited to our preferred payment method.

Comment by Confident-Beat2718: Some people say we will be getting it next year after our semester fee had been settled

Comment by aminlee9: Yes. They will offset first. Any remainder amount will then be distributed next year..

Comment by Confident-Beat2718: So its possible for the semester fees to be completely settled before the disbursement of bursary, right?
