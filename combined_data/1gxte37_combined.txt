Body: Is anyone gonna mention ppl who approach you to offer you to be a partner for their e commerce business , via directly ‘recruiting’ physically or thru LinkedIn. 
Your experience ? Cause it seems soo shady, them advertising financial freedom thru multiple incomes, when the fact is that their business model only benefits the so called ‘Mentors’ where those under them earn barely to none.

Comment by AtomZones: They claim that it’s not about recruiting but here’s how it works, a friend who u have never talked to will start talking to you on like ur studies, ur life, ur goals, then they offer you this ‘business opportunity’, if u actually followed thru, then you’ll have to pay 30 dollars for an independent business owner (IBO) account, in which if u recruit more u get a portion of their sales too, 

1 person recruits 4
The 4 recruits 16
16 recruits 64

Forming the so called pyramid scheme, as u earn more money from recruiting than actually selling, but the thing is you’ll barely earn money unless you’re at the top of this scheme where as the majority of people lose money and barely even know their own products

In the end u gonna start seeing everyone as a business opportunity, when in reality you’re just helping the company make even more money rather than starting your own business.

Comment by beehoon23: Yeah, I received it twice and they all come from the same university as well. My friend was invited to join a session and realised it was MLM.

Another secondary school randomly messaged me one dayand asked if I am interested to help his father run his business. I told him not interested

Comment by Vinhunter666: There’s a few in tp I went for their talks before, they are from Amway. So be careful

Comment by Bubbly_Accident_2718: I have a first meeting scheduled on Saturday 30th Nov, 11am at TampinesOne for a $8M project. If you are keen to invest, come lend your ears

Comment by Vinhunter666: Ye so right , once u done the calculations spending $250 barely makes you $4. And they call this investing in your own business which is BS. Moreover, they call it network marketing which also means using your friends and family to make money.

Comment by AtomZones: It’s very cult like and they ask u to advertise their products to families and friends

Comment by AtomZones: bro trying to scam LOL

Comment by Bubbly_Accident_2718: Never ask you for money, what? Come only to listen?
