Body: I got my enrollment email. I am a pr and its given me a option to apply for tution grant which sounds great. But it says I need to work in Singapore for 3 years after graduation.

Does this mean for my internship in year 3 I cant work overseas and when I graduate I probably need to go ns so does it continue after ns

Comment by Altruistic_Hand3617: You can go overseas for internship if you are given the opportunities to do so. it does not take the internship into consideration iirc since you are still studying. It continues after NS, unless u become a citizen as the 3 year bond is waived.
