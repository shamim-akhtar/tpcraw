Body: hello i have an asus vivobook s15 intel core i7 can i use it for engineering courses? i bought it in 2023 and i hardly use it. prob only touch it once a month or not even at all for months. not sure if it will be compatible as i assume its not the latest. thanks in advance 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

hard drive (i assume its storage?): 464gb
memory: 16gb
processor: 11th gen intel core 7

Comment by DivoKing69: It really boils down to what course you take but the i7 is the base requirement for a lot of courses so you should be safe?? But it also does depend on your gpu specs. You have it better than me anyways I’m stuck with a m4 pro MacBook Pro
