Body: Hi, I have a friend who is currently deciding whether to take Guided Learning or Sustainbility In Action. She knows what SCA is about, but she also wants to know what is Guided Learning about. Anyone here who chose to do Guided Learning mind sharing what it is about and why she should/should not take it?

Comment by NyandaKun: Hi there, I have done guided learning before. 

So Guided Learning is like you learn by yourself with no pressure, no stress and it's yours to control whatever you do, from planning to learning to executing what you have learnt to reflect what you have learnt. It's very simple but I would say it takes quite alot of commitment if you really struggle in managing your own schedules. 

So there are two options :   
1. School initiated - you can choose based on the topics that your school gave for GL (if you do not know where to start and my pick). While you don't have to go through the complicated application, the slot is quite limited so first come first serve or your lecturer see your interest lor.   
2. Student initiated - you can decide what kind of topic you want to learn and it can be anything (not learning how to playing valorant ofc ; too simple). However, you have to go through the application and you have to wait for approval in order to take GL. Lecturers would need to find a learning facilitator for you in assisting in learning a particular topics (same for option 1) and the topics that you want to learn cannot coincide with what your course has to offer. e.g. I am in FNC and I cannot study let say Baking and Culinary Technology in GL because that is what I am going to do in the core module. But what I can do is to bend it by making the topic clear that I want to explore on Mediterranean which is an in depth knowledge of a particular region. 

Personally, GL is  a great module for those who want to learn independently and to be competent without having to rely on other people for information. I myself find it annoying or not willing to learn from LMS because the teaching style in TP is sometimes not suited to my personal needs. So I prefer to study using my own techniques. 

At the end of the programme, you have created a portfolio which would benefit you for job application and yea it really does. 

  
I have made my own portfolio during GL , you can take a look : [https://nyanjustin.wixsite.com/justinyong](https://nyanjustin.wixsite.com/justinyong)

Also, here is the link to the GL handbook (let me know if unable to access): [https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:93d65f69-496c-39ca-8847-36a3e5e064b3](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:93d65f69-496c-39ca-8847-36a3e5e064b3)

Hope this helps!

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: Guided learning is basically you choose any topic you want to do and just execute it,, itâ€™s pass/fail (at least my time) and you have to submit a proposal before hand

Comment by Previous-Basket3475: Choose guided learning if your gpa high. Legit free mod. I know someone who put his guided learning as weight loss. So he just document his weight loss journey lol.
