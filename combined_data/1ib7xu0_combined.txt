Body: After I have found out that I have partial red green color blindness, I still want to apply for the b.med science but Im also on the risk of failing their medical check up. The main thing I want to ask is if I failed the check up and had to give up on my first choice, do I still get to choose my second/third choices or will they just assign me a suitable course?

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: someone ik also had the same issue as you,but  he got his last choice which was the only suitable course for him. However, he did well and got a 3.99.

Comment by Ryuable: My first choice is B.med science. However, my other choices are IT-related so will they arrange it for me with a different science course or is there a chance for my choices?

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: tbh if I'm not wrong based on the medical report, I think u won't be eligible for IT courses if you are color blind. I might be wrong, maybe you talk to TP school admission officer ya.

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: i mean call the sch regarding this

Comment by Ryuable: Ohhh dang I checked it and saw it was ok? Anyway, I just wanted to know that if they arrange your course by themselves with a similar field (like if B.med is rejected;something else in the science) or do they consider your choices on different fields?
