Body: I know this may seem obvious to others but first time retaking quiz for me and I remembered there was something like a 50% cap last time they talked about retakes even if you get all correct the next time.

Can anyone who knows more of the specifics tell me if it's a different percentage or is depending on the subject or anything like that

Comment by definitelytroaxx: if ur other components cannot pass, retest grade will be activated (cap 50% of your grade e.g retest got A will still only give C max for that "test" component) and apply it to your existing components to help u pass the module. it's like this for every mod iirc
