Comment by scams-are-everywhere: Enrichment is capped at 20, service youâ€™ll only get points if the role titles are different, achievement and leadership no cap

Comment by W4773N: Service SEAL points are capped at 120, and are split into 4 sub-categories with a cap of 30 SEAL points each, namely Main-Organising Committee (like organisers, coordinators), Sub-Organising Committee (like performer, emcee), Specialised Roles (like school ambassadors, editor) and Event Support (event helper)

Enrichment are capped at 20

Achievement has no cap and starts off with 5 SEAL points for participation in a internal competition (20 SEAL points for external competition) followed by bonus SEAL points of 5 for third, 10 for second and 15 for first.

Leadership also has no cap and starts off with 10 SEAL points for being in class committee, 30 SEAL points for being in CCA main committee, but usually they give 20 SEAL points for Class Committee and 40 SEAL points for CCA main committee
