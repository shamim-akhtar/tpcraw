Body: for context i'm a Y1 student studying IT. as far as my resume goes, i don't really have a lot to show as a IT student (a few prototypes of UI/UX and 3 hackathons as a participant) so i feel like i wouldn't be offered an internship anyways.

 i only have COMT and LOMA left for tests which will be done by first 2 weeks of august then i have holidays until october. 

im currently deciding against just working a full time job or applying for internships for 3 months (and if anyone has any company they could point me too would be helpful üôèüèª) IT seniors pls comment ur own experience if you have taken internships before your mandated poly internship thank you!!!

Comment by Vinhunter666: I think not so early , maybe next year, but try to find part time jobs related to what you are learning. Cos most companies won't hire y1 students because or age and other factors, moreover , since u are applying without school,  so you will have to compete with uni students that also want to intern at that company.

Comment by iamnothingbuta: 3 HACKATHONS? I am Y2 and have never been to hackathon until y2, i think you are doing fine, just grind seal points

Comment by Puzzleheaded_Tree404: Do it in year 2 and at least build a foundation first.
