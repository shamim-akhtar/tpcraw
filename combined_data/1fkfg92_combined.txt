Check out this website made by the TP ITSIG. Should be applicable to those taking Common ICT as well.

Comment by definitelytroaxx: yooo thank u i have this website alr :p i meant like i wanted to get a head start in certain topics bc my y2 friends told me python we'll be learning stacks and queues and i wanted to know if i could learn any concepts for js/html/css before sch starts

Comment by mount2010: For JS/HTML/CSS, I'd highly recommend trying it yourself (download Visual Studio Code, then you only need a web browser to open the HTML files you wrote) and I like Mozilla Developer Network's guide on those. They're all linked together. 

Regarding stacks and queues you can read/watch about those. They're basically ways to organize data so we can manipulate/store them easily.

Comment by definitelytroaxx: thank you!!
