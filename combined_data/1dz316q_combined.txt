Body: is it just me or what but like my bursary still pending for approved even though I applied term  1 😭 

I have a large family so like the verification was only completed like mid June as they ask quite a lot of of additional documents like some repeated even though I gave them alr ..😔

Am i considered in term 1 batch or term 2 batch since like the verification was only completed  in mid June?

Comment by Vinhunter666: I think too many people apply ,too much verification to do. Hopefully by Aug we get .

Comment by yeoors: omg 😔 I won’t be surprised if they accidentally missed me out because it’s not the first time they pull that stunt 😭✋

Comment by yeoors: RIGHT ..like all my friends alr got their bursary and here i am waiting AHHAHA

Comment by yeoors: hopefully 🙏

Comment by strwberri111: same sia HAHAH are ur friends new applicants or have they applied before? Most of my friends I know that just apply this year, got it much quicker as compared to past applicants

Comment by yeoors: Like most of my friends are new applicants except for one of my friend .. but they all got their bursary around  the same timing
