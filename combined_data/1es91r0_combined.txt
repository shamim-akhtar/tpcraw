Comment by Hot_Path_1438: tpvb is very competitive HAHAHAHA they really pick the best of the best so atb atb

Comment by theuselessmastermind: unfortunately for sports they often look for the best of the best yk, since a lot of people want to join... some sports have recreational versions (?) but vb is super competitive

Comment by No_Kaleidoscope_8892: Tbh if u dh prior experience they won't choose u one so don't waste ur time
Like u may have like potential and stuff but once u say u sec sch dh they most likely won't choose speaking frm experience haha
But like u miss all the chances u don't take so if u wanna just go for the trials 
Either ways can be fun also if u go with friends

Comment by LetterheadMost3677: Aww man.. so sec sch cca is more important than anyth else? So club experience wont help me gain anything ?üò≠üò≠

Comment by Downtown-Leek4106: go for the trials. if u can show your potential/skills they might still consider u

Comment by No_Kaleidoscope_8892: Club experience also helps I think hahah I forgot about that
But I think what they looking for is basically ppl that have played the sport in a more serious manner(not like pe y'know)
If uw to trial I say go for it then all the best !
