Body: Hi, im trying to start assignment 2 for adev dbav where i have to make a full stack website. anyone feeling overwhelmed by the amount of instructions there are? The lecturers went through creating the APIs and server side scripting very briefly and covered it in about a week and now we are supposed to make a full stack website. we just touched the introduction to javascript 2-3 weeks ago and now we are expected to create a full stack website. lab demo videos were provided but the questions in the lab are not correlated to the assignment specs at all. help???

Comment by pokkagreentea100: I'm not too sure, but I suppose that it will be covered the next term.

Right now, I have asked my teacher regarding it, but I don't expect a fast reply since it's the term break. Right now, all I did was to download the necessary stuff & create the website design. maybe you can get started on the design.

Comment by yvonne1298_: dont start the design first!! if u start the design then there would be alot of deletion later needed on as ur design is hard coded. start on backend like inserting mock data and verifying them.

Comment by mount2010: Probably not as their focus is on testing html/css ability + year 1 students don't learn React. Only Information Technology students learn React in Y2 IIRC.

(Sad since I know react and all that already but I'm still stuck in poly, help)

Comment by pokkagreentea100: when I talk about design I mean like the background colours and all. all the static stuff.

Comment by mount2010: By design they mean the same thing as assignment 1, come up with a frontend. This is just HTML/CSS. You should be able to do this.

Refer to the lab sheet for the last week before the term break for how to make the CRUD API backend.

Comment by pokkagreentea100: they focused on killing us first ðŸ˜­ teaching all of these just weeks before assignment is due

Comment by yvonne1298_: oh yeah yeah makes sense
