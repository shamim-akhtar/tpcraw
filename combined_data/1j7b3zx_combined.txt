Body: im gg to pfp@tp in cbp course and i just want to know how the day to day is like? I live all the way in the west and honestly, im more afraid of getting burnt out from the travel compared to the workload(which i heard is a LOT). 

anyways, is it more laxed like 3 days of sch a week or 5 days of school everyday? Im planning to join a cca so i just wanted some insight!!

btw i have more questions on my previous post if you guys would like to answer

THANK YOU!

Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: Hi OP, the distance is in fact a factor that can cause burnt out over time. But if you're interested in the course you're doing I'm sure you will be fine. So atb!

Comment by No-Philosopher4554: I think it might be tiring to travel all the way to tp especially for morning lessons? But if u genuinely enjoy the course youâ€™ll be ok I think
