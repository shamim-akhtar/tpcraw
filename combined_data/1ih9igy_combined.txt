Comment by AntiDroneOperators: Hi there Yr 1 student here who streamed out of CEP into AEG, For my Cohort the AEG,AEL and BZE streaming happened right after sem 1 (year 1.1) and your allocation is dependent on your 1st choice second choice etc and on the grades you get for Sem 1.1 it’s pretty easy as long as you watch all the lectures and aren’t too lazy you can get a high GPA and easily get into BZE. 
Do not make the same mistake as me where i goofed around the entire first term of the sem and locked in last minute as you have a lot of CA (continuing Assements) which add up to a large amount of your grade 
if you have any questions you can message me sia
