Body: Hi. I am a y1 student going to be in sem 2 next month for computer engineering. Is there anything I should prepare for? And if you have any resources such as some topics, notes or information, I would really appreciate if you donâ€™t mind sharing. Thank you!!

Comment by Alpha-232: EMATH2 is mostly differentiation, integration and limit functions.

EDEVCKT mainly covers diode, special diode, amplifiers, bipolar junction transistor amplifiers frequency response and operational amplifiers.

DFUND2 covers counters, shift registers, data storages, signal conversions, and integrated circuit technologies

Comment by Icy-Tip3135: Do you mind sharing if you have the files? I just wanted to try seeing some of them prior to school because last sem, I was kind of getting behind with reviewing topics after the teacher explains.

Comment by Alpha-232: Yes, I can share with you the reference books I used
