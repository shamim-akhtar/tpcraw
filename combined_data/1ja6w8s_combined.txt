Body: Hi new y1 student,for context I'm obese is it possible for me to join basketball.I have  experience from  playing during pe and I enjoyed it.Furthermore, something I noticed was that like alot of the players were skinny so I don't know if it's possible to join.

Comment by iamnothingbuta: playing during pe vs playing competitively is a big difference, you might get cooked during tryouts

Comment by casper_07: They’re looking for mostly starter level players in the CCA, if u don’t have the skill to back it up, they’ll reject u even as a substitute player. U can try for sure, go there have some fun, never try never know all that and see for yourself if you’d like

Comment by ApocSanma: Be prepared to run like hell for conditioning, drills n whatnot for bball in general. Esp since most players would already have skills from prev exp theyll likely be doing a lot of teamwork/strategy drilling(match prep) other than touching up on dribbling n finishing.

Comment by Different_Scratch124: What if I short like  183cm 

Comment by iamnothingbuta: Tbf from previous comments they look for players with secondary school experience/ competition experience, so if you don't have it then ya
