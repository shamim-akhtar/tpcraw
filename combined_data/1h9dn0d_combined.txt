Comment by usermanokok55: Back in the day this was graded

Comment by Aikawa_Tofu_0240: Why am I designing things in a course that's not even part of the design faculty???

Comment by yq27: bro same! and my lecturer made us solve a prob that is related to the dip im studying sia. Bruh dnt so diff from this eh, I like dnt, but not this!!!!

Comment by BudgetDevv: Yeah innova was honestly boring, most of my peers GPT-ed everything. Good thing that it is a non-graded subject

Comment by Baxtonwarls: So valid, just focus on other projects tbh

Comment by Altruistic_Hand3617: Honestly found Innova to be a fun and one of the better modules for me. Is the hate cause it’s ungraded now so it seems like a waste of time or?

Comment by Hopeful_Sea78: my innova teacher intruded my private space during an event 😭😭 (i didnt recognise him, so i felt violated)

Comment by Disastrous-Gold-4700: REAL

Comment by Latter_Special655: innova honestly me and my friends just bs our way thru our prototype was a deck of cards but we oni made like 10+ cards i think then we just bs our presentation and our lecturer still pass us lmao

Comment by NyandaKun: I only think that INNOVA is fun because of how expressive the lecturer is and just give us a lot of reality stuff. 

The only thing I find it bored or I hate is the project guideline which frustrate me the most because it’s a joint project  with another core module which both modules have a separate guidelines 🙄. Wish the guidelines be standardized omg

Comment by noownoow: I'm sorry OP, but you're so real for that😭😭

Comment by Senti_sock: omg it is non-graded now!!! It used to be a graded subject and thats the only subject I got like a D

Comment by Aikawa_Tofu_0240: Perhaps, but also due to how irrelevant it is to some people's courses. If you're doing design, engineering, IT, etc it would still make sense, but if you're in HSS it doesn't feel quite necessary... That's what I think, I might be wrong

Comment by BudgetDevv: My condolences, TPfun really sucks especially when you're trying to aim for a good course and / or university.  
  
If it helps you feel better, I would have achieved 4.0 GPA last semester if I didn't get an F grade for ecomms. It may seem trivial, but my cGPA went down by 0.2, so rip my hopes of getting into my desired course

Comment by Evening_Attorney9858: Just a question, tpfun is just either pass or fail right?

Comment by someonenamedval: only ecomms and procomms are graded now

Comment by BudgetDevv: Unfortunately, our GPA is still partially measured in terms of our ability to corporate speak in a superficial manner :p

Comment by Senti_sock: U GUYS GOT LUCKY!!
