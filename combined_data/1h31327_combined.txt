Comment by sprite700: Rather than asking reddit, do the smart thing and report it to the school so they can investigate through CCTV. Theres cameras everywhere.

Comment by SameGround8126: PINK LAPTOP OR ISIT THE CASE? if itâ€™s the case then it mightt be mineðŸ¥¹

Comment by SameGround8126: did you read the part where i said i made a reportðŸ˜“

Comment by sprite700: Oh if you made a report then its fine, chase the school for a reply. Checking the CCTV footage should be easy enough for them.
