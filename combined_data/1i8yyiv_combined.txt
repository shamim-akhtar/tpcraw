Comment by nothappygooutside: if you did use generative AI and you didn't declare, you might be flagged for plagiarism. You should clarify with your tutor asap

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: i only use for when they ask to check with AI and compare it with your answer.

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: i did not use for any other things. only use for when the problem ask me to do

Comment by nothappygooutside: check the assessment rubrics/instructions, is the AI declaration compulsory to submit? if you didn't submit along with your assignment it can still lead to marks lost under organisation. i think you should clarify with your tutor

Comment by nothappygooutside: yup so if the assignment requires you to use AI and you don't declare your use of AI that may be flagged as plagiarism. Please contact your tutor to clarify with them
