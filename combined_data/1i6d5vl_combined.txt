Body: hi guys idk if ill get shamed on this subreddit for posting about this but just wanted to take a shot.

im just here looking for a electric guitarist around the age of 16 to 23 (not very impt how old u are tbh) cause im really out of ideas on where to look i already tried soft and didnt work.

the artists that we usually play or are planning to play are like king gnu, kessoku band, kenshi yonezu, vaundy, pretty much any artist under the sun for jrock or jpop, maneskin, and all time low.

were also planning to be gig ready by this year and possibly compose original music eventually

if ur interested just fill out this thing below and dm this reddit account
