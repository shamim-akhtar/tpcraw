Body: hi guys, my friend just submitted a project LATE and its worth 10% of our grade, we would both get the same design mark. i’m just worried how badly it would affect my grade. i’m in engine school so is it a 10% deduction after each day or is it 20% of the final grade?

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: iirc you lose 10% of that specific project's grade for 1 day late, 20% for 2 days late and 100% for 3 days late

so assuming you submitted 1 day late, you guys can only score up to 9% out of the 10%

after each project there will be a short survey thingie where you can rate your team members by how well they did, if you want you can talk about how your team member who was in charge of submitting the project submitted it late, also can just go up to the teacher themselves and just tell them what happened
