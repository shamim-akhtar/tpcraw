Comment by error_urbitch: Hii i applied to Fashion back in 2023 (when it was still ADM)
For the aptitude test, I remembered the first question being specifically if you had your own fashion brand what wld you name it + what wld it be known for (may have changed) Along with like, having to like design a set of clothes/bags w geometric shapes provided in a square
Unironically its not that stressful just bring some colouring materials (ive seen ppl bring watercolours) and u are good. Good Luck for eae!!
