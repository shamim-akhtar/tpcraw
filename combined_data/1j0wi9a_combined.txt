Comment by Ok-Engineering143: -Ah shi here we go again ,
-Don't worry its normal. 
-In fact , it may be unavailable to students till sch begins or even several weeks into the semester (situational)
-The system is pretty weird; don't overthink it. 
-When the time comes, it'll be made available to you 
-Stay Cool & Patient

Comment by Gamer_dude12341: Hi, I'm also an enrolling student. The enrollment guide said wait for about a week after completing enrollment. It worked fine for me.
