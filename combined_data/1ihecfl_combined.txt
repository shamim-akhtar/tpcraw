Body: Im not familiar with this, so appreciate for any help or advice. My daughter's 1st choice was IAD (T22) Interior Architecture and Design and 2nd choice was CDP (T71) for Common Design Programme. 

She got accepted for the 2nd choice (T71), but i read the course description that she can still go to T22 after 1 sem, is my understanding correct? are there any points or advise i should tell her ? thanks in advance for anyone who will answer.

Comment by iamnothingbuta: she gets exposed to modules she will like which may influence her future design course preference other than the original one, but if she doesnt perform good for first sem she wont have the luxury to choose her dream course in design

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: Yup u are correct
In fact my friend did the same path 
She will spent half a year in common before choosing their specialisation

Comment by Kitapitapy: Yep for students in common programs they'll get to choose their diploma of specialisation after one Sem(what's offered by the school so in your case architecture) 
It's based on how well she performs in Sem 1, but typically you'll get within your first 3 choices if you don't perform extraordinarily bad. For the first year all students of that school have the same modules which you can find on the school site :) 
Goodluck to your daughter hope she enjoys being in TP :)
