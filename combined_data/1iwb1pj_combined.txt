Comment by nothappygooutside: hihi, nothing much u can study when it comes to business law. you just need to be familiar with the legal principles and remedies. also IRAC is rarely used by actual tp law students lol it's like PEEL in secondary school. don't have to strictly follow.

i find that IRAC complicates everything :/

Comment by _potatostick: is it still open book? if yes all i did was familiarise myself with the location of each point, so ik where to flip during exam. for format i donâ€™t rmb if i followed exactly irac but it was smt like (short, direct ans like if they ask what law or yes no) then (copy paste the theory) > (apply the theory to the qn) > (repeat my ans w thus,â€¦)

Comment by gigiiii95: Yep itâ€™s open book! i think i will follow the same answering approach. Did u score well for business law if u dm saying lol

Comment by No-Philosopher4554: What was the format of the paper like
