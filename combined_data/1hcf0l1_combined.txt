Comment by mount2010: There's still the assignment, you can do this!

DSAG was mostly programming knowledge so I would highly recommend you watch some youtube videos and do practice over the vacation.

Even if your diploma isn't really connected to programming, if you are working with computers you'll definitely run into problems where you need programming. Can't use ChatGPT if you don't understand what ChatGPT is giving you.

Comment by Roknoz: Wow, its been more than 10 years since i’ve graduated and I can still remember what DSAG is. Really made an impression eh

Comment by Leather_Ad2922: is there a retest if I got F?

Comment by BudgetDevv: Yes, but capped at D IIRC. You might wish to consider joining the peer learning program for DSAG

Comment by definitelytroaxx: yea have i think

Comment by mount2010: I'd say don't worry too much about minimum grade to pass, just try your best to meet the A requirements. If you go in with the mentality that you will just get D then you will definitely get D.

Most important is answer every section to the best of your ability. 

What works for me, treat it like an exam, drink coffee/tea/your preferred beverage and do whatever you do before an exam. Then for your first time doing it (starting out the assignment), try to fill in every section just enough. You can add cherries on top later.

Comment by AtomZones: what’s that

Comment by BudgetDevv: Peer learning program? Basically, they select the subjects' top performers from the previous batch to mentor students who are currently taking said subjects.

From what I understand, some of the weaker students are shortlisted to attend it, but one could sign up through their lecturer as well.
