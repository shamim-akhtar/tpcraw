Body: I messed up the aptitude test for school of engineering, did 31 out of 37 questions as I didnt finish in time. Its highly likely that im not getting an interview due to this, Is it possible to appeal?

Comment by Fun-Astronaut-3877: hey there! to be honest, i've never heard of anyone appealing but i mean you could give it a shot if uw. however js cross ur fingers and hope the questions u answered were good enough. there were people who rlly messed up their aptitude test but still got in somehow loll. even if eae doesn't work out its ok... focus on jae and ur o's cos at the end of the day the marks still do matter, eae is js a fallback in case. :)

Comment by OPDuckyYT_Cod: Can’t appeal bro just hope that you got most of the qns you knew how to do right

Comment by Public_Individual_: You can try not sure if they’ll accept, something similar happened to me last year and i ended up with a 17/35 after not completing the last few questions. Still managed to get the interview and EAE for the course i wanted accepted. Hopefully this eases you abit, all the best and don’t give up 🙏🏼
