Comment by NyandaKun: To answer your question, from most modules I have experienced so far, there’s no way we are able to tell how much do we score for class participation.

But one thing that I look out for if you are scoring well for class participation is that your lecturer is impressed by your efforts put in during tutorial and practical. May not be obvious from their facial expression and the way they behave toward you , but it would take practice to find out.

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: if your planning to add in class participation to roughly estimate how much % you have so far for the semester, just take class part as 2 or 3

Comment by skelethepro: More than 0(I'm not in poly)

Comment by NotHighAchiever: y’all go to class?

Comment by Which_Action_5554: Thinking out loud : would asking directly helps ?

Comment by Street_Musician_580: just remember to do ur online quizes/lab submissions and also be active in class!

Comment by Bright-Local7759: 2-3/10% a bit less ah. For y1s i think thats almost impossible unless u legit never do any of ur tutorials or online quizzes but u got speak up a bit in class

Comment by BunnyGaming1: huh so little...

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: I tried asking teachers about how much class part I got a few times before, it's usually a toss up

most of the time they'll say they can't tell you but some times they tell you the minimum

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: 2-3% is for out of 5%, like if class part is spread between theory and prac

for the ones that are out of 10% then you put as 4-7

Comment by Bright-Local7759: If ur lecturer remembers ur name vv well and looks for u specifically for ur work and all, then u shld be scoring quite well for cp. maybe id say 7-8/10%

Comment by Which_Action_5554: Be frank, let them know u don't need to know exactly, but a thought gauge, as you are aiming for (?) eg to qualify for bursary, scholarships, etc
