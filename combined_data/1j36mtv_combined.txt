Comment by TheoryPatient6067:  I got A A A, quite expected (last min studied test/quiz and was rushing assignment). Praying it pulls my other subjects

Comment by mount2010: A B+ A here.

Honestly I really didn't like the assignment, it was way too much yapping and barely related to data structures at all (more like "how to draw digital diagram course"). The only trick was "stacks are not good to represent a queue" (duh).

Comment by Low_Nobody_5690: not that good. ='(. How about you?

Comment by AtomZones: Top 25% of the cohort got higher than 77% in terms of grade, the other top 75% of the cohort got 69% and below in terms of grade.

Comment by Lower_Cantaloupe_477: So easy A A A , idk how yall struggled stupid or what sia

Comment by Low_Nobody_5690: waahh. teach me how u study.

Comment by Kitapitapy: Right especially the last part was so random for a data structures class(????)

Comment by Low_Nobody_5690: i tried comparing my answers to the feedbacks given on politemall; i didnt use stacks and for the validation part, i think mine is not that 'general'. but still, did not get my desired marks. My second quiz was also quite bad. haiizzzzzz

Comment by No_Afternoon_3157: Where did you get these numbers?

Comment by Low_Nobody_5690: for the module as a whole or for the assignment specifically?

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Aiyo.. relax bro. Tbh the tests were designed in a way where they had varying mark allocation for harder questions. 

Example, a qn holds 2.5 marks (worth 5 qns) which can greatly bring down a grade if not answered well. Having 2-3 of the 2.5 marks qns wrong can bring you to a D easilyâ€¦. Quite unfortunate but thats how it is.

Even though it wasnt hard for us, i can understand why one with not much experience would struggle.
