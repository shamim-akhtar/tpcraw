Body: question to seniors who did intern in 3.1:
i heard intern gpa only released with transcript upon graduation, is it true? so i wonâ€™t know my entire year 3 gpa until i graduate? 

so if i apply for uni using first 4 sems results, and if my later 2 sems pull me down my offer if any will be revoked?

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: Usually you apply uni with partial results, got condition one

Comment by Great_Dimension3606: no, usually they will release per normal, also uni usually requires first 5 sems
