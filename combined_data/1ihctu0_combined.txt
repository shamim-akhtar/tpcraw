Comment by nothappygooutside: I'm not from TP a&f but i know a bunch of people from a&f in my batch (the graduating y3s). I don't like most of them because they like to post capcut edits of themselves, those emo emo type or always cover face one (what's the point of a thirst trap if your face is covered). There are actually some decent people I've met there actually, they are the more reserved types. 

I know of one guy there who got a significant amount of drama and attention because he molested another student or something, don't know the specifics of it or the guy's name. All my information is retrieved from my a&f friends fyi, so i don't know if it's true.

many modules are continuations of previous modules so you need to be extremely consistent and have a strong foundation, otherwise you'll be lost and struggling to pull your GPA up. the course is 90% numbers, so if you hate math, you'll hate the course. 

avoid unnecessary drama because i hear of so much drama from this course... over the smallest things. people have drama because of group formation. can you believe it? there was a guy with no group and he was forced to join either group A or B, both of which were girl-only groups. both groups don't want him so they drama drama not happy with each other. there's more, such as people want to commit suicide and all, but can't be bothered to type it all out. 

as with all BUS diplomas, please get to know your classmates well so you know who to avoid during group projects. find a solid group of friends to get you through poly.
