Comment by lostclip: Wifi name is TP-STUDENT. Username is your admin number and password is your school Microsoft account password.

Comment by pokkagreentea100: I can't remember exactly but I think for school WiFi use the TP-Student, username is your matrix number and password is your current password for your school Microsoft account 

it's been a while so I may be wrong haha
