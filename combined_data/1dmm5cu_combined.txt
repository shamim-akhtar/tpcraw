Comment by strwberri111: not from biz but my timetable also like tht, anyways if im not mistaken, usually the timetable for semester shld be the same, it will only change when u take new mods next sem

Comment by No-Photograph-621: I think you should be able to access the timetable properly on a different device that isn't a phone eg. IPad, tablet, laptop. Otherwise, the classes should be the same, unless you have a module that only went on from week 1-8, or have a new module that is just starting this term.

Comment by Apprehensive-Trip667: same problem with me here no clue what happened luckily i had a screenshot of my timetable

Comment by ChillFluffwolf: No, I tried it on my PC, no timetable there either. But not to worry, the timetable SHOULD be the same until next semester (do modules even start in the middle of semesters?)
