Body: hi snrs!! for those who did the subj selection, how was the process like? when you select your elective clusters is it like u number them 1-5 on your preferences or you just choose one/two as your top choices and hope for the best.

i also heard its fcfs but the selection process is so long is it also based on gpa??
