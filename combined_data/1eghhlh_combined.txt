Body: I lost my whole wallet which had my matric card

So how do I replace it,I need it for my exam in 3 weeks

I checked online, they only accept axs payment which i don't have, i  thought can pay with dbs or posb

Or can i go to the tp office and ask them to help replace?

Please help meeeðŸ˜­

Comment by wank_for_peace: Find it hard to believe that in 2024, they only accept AXS.

What they teach in poly? Year 2000 stuff?

Comment by grandmasterlau: The AXS payment is available through their app or eService which is linked with Nets, VISA/Master, PayNow.

Otherwise you could try calling the student centre, but I suspect they are not keen on cash or nets payment.

Comment by IndependentNo6105: if you dont have matric you could use ezlink but sometimes if your examiner is fierce they wont allow so worse come to worse just try

Comment by AtomZones: When did u lost it?Â
