Body: I took the Igcse (Edexcel) in May-June series. Here are my grades. I only got grade 3 in Eng Language B.
For some reasons, I can't retake exam in Oct Nov. That's why I have to apply with this grade. I planned to apply IT or civil engineering course in the following intake. Do I have chance of being acceptedðŸ˜¢.

Comment by Happy-Mission-5901: Obviously not!

Comment by Smooth_Theory_2063: Sorry if you failed English, I donâ€™t think so

Comment by Yannaing1984: It's been a long time so not sure it's still there, usually poly will have their own entrance exam to sit in. Usually, it's for international students. You can ask for the school to join this type of exam to get in.

please check with the polytechnic instead.

Comment by Handrwik: Thank you for your honesty. I appreciate your perspective.

Comment by Handrwik: Thanks for your response. Unfortunately, retaking the exam isnâ€™t possible for me for some reasons. I guess I should give it a try anywayðŸ˜¢
