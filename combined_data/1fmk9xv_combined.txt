Body: Hello, I just want to ask, is it possible for one to still get achievement SEAL points with no sports CCA or going to competitions (WSS, etc)?

Comment by calimato: Cann, take part in other ccaâ€™s one time events. or volunteering programmes. Some talks and programmes are made compulsory (attendance) by your lecturers, so make sure you attend for the easy seal points
