Comment by strwberri111: bro, mine also haven’t approved yet 😭😭🙏taking a lil tooooo long. Im guessing cos this year more applicants apply for it at the start of the term

Comment by Secure-Emu3730: From what i understand, the bursary will be used to offset yr outstanding tuition fees first (if you have not paid it yet), before any remaining balance is disbursed to you.

Comment by Constant-Education19: Mine hasn't been approved yet either 😭

Comment by iamnothingbuta: takes a while just wait

Comment by Marifyuri: Just scream and shout “but I chinese mah, why bursary so long take one.” Then you shout “ching chong, corona virus” sure will approve one.
