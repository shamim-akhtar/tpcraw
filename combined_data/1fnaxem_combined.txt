Body: Jus asking as the requirement for scholarship is like gpa of 3 for y1s1
Do I still have another chance if I do well for sem 2 ? Like I did really badly this sem and for next sem if I do well like a 3.5 for example will they just look at the 3.5 and not my current result? Because the descriptions for the awards they are just counting for the semester

Comment by Due-Philosophy1389: I think if itâ€™s only offered for y1s1 then that means s1 must do well idt itâ€™ll be offered again during s2 :/

Comment by Alpha-232: You can try to apply for other scholarships when you are in your year 2, given that you do well for the subsequent semester and participate in CCAs.

Comment by Exact_Ad6736: Cumulative don't have >3.8 and above don't bother wasting your time ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Comment by Dizdieek: I tried it once when I was in the director List at one point in the semester but I got rejected

Comment by butteryink_2007: Not sure if this helps, but I am applying for the NTUC Starter Awards because apparentlyÂ the GPA requirement on their website is just 3.0. It seems this scholarship focuses more on CCAs and leadership experience.Â This is the link that I applied with:Â https://www.lit.sg/ntuc-starter-awards
