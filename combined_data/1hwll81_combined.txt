Comment by Content_DeletERROR: I’m not sure so take mine with a grain of salt but your MC would overwrite your attendance

Comment by Melodic_Cap_2280: it will say u are on mc. if u haven’t submitted ur mc, instead of putting the whole duration of the mc (which is 2 days), u can just apply it for 1 day. this way ur mc won’t overwrite ur attendance if u were to attend class tmr

Comment by Content_DeletERROR: I’ve seen my teachers take attendance and the MCs are automatically filled in for them and the chers can’t change
