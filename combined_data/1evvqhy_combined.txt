Body: Hi, I forgot to submit my course evaluation survey and I am not sure what to do since I contacted the IT department and they said that they cannot do much either. So do I just leave it alone or is there a way for me to resubmit the surveys?

Comment by Altruistic_Hand3617: Your release dates for grades will be delayed by 3 days other than that nothing else will be done so u can just leave it alone.

Comment by Tofufluffmeh: Alright thank you so much!
