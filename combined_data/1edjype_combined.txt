Comment by pokkagreentea100: settings → net work → advanced →port forwarding

make sure your host port is 443 not 100443

Comment by Latter_Special655: im in yr 2 already but i rmb struggling wif this last yr for cyfun i remember even naming my gc name CYnotsoFUN but then in the end i cant get it and end up going for my presentation wif my shit not working i still ended up passing the mod tho

Comment by Kitapitapy: I had problems with mine too and I searched online for answers but couldn't find any so idk this might help you out or not but check your gateway for your VM and make sure it's the same as your laptop's IP address :b but mine the problem was the website would time out when I searched so uhm idk if it really applies to you but if really everything else don't work you can just try I guess :b

Comment by AtomZones: So, u did it?

Comment by ParticularCover9350: trust its not😂😂

Comment by pokkagreentea100: the second thing is in your VM, make sure the website the default website.

then default website, go to bindings. do not touch port 80. add new, Https, 443, 10.0.2.15

Comment by ParticularCover9350: nah cause i think im actl gonna skip the 2nd part of network services

Comment by ParticularCover9350: thank you!! actually im open to any solutions rn because NOTHING IS WORKING

Comment by Kitapitapy: Also you could try searching on stackoverflow with your error code (site can't be reached is not the error code btw it's the line below that line) it helped me a lot when I kept getting errors :b

Comment by pokkagreentea100: if you type in Https://10.0.2.15 in your VM, it should work . if it doesn't, chances are your host 127.0.0.1 won't work as well

Comment by ParticularCover9350: but there are ppl in my class who do it so easily???

Comment by ParticularCover9350: BRO i typed in 10.0.2.15 in the vm and got an error help

Comment by None: [deleted]

Comment by pokkagreentea100: you definitely configured something wrong.

go to your IIS manager and sites.

for 10.0.2.15, do not create a new site, rather use the default site that they already have and bind 443 & 10.0.2.15 
remember the Https

Comment by pokkagreentea100: please also ensure your host, guest IP and port is correct.

Comment by ParticularCover9350: i am.....

Comment by ParticularCover9350: who are you.....

Comment by ParticularCover9350: do we need to put the host name to anything

Comment by pokkagreentea100: nah
