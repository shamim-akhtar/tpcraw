Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Assuming the sch released the semester 1’s result 4 weeks before semester 2, the result date is approx on 24th March. Dont take my word for it

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Not sure how u r retrieving such info as it is not stated in Oei

Comment by pokkagreentea100: hi, please refer to the announcement with the title ' SEMESTRAL EXAMINATION NOTICE [24 Feb (Mon) - 7 Mar 2025 (Fri)]' , you have to scroll down a bit. 

to find the exam results release date you scroll all the way below under the section 'Release of Examination Results' in the announcement post.
