Body: Hi, just wanted to know if the computer engineering course has notes or materials that the  professors would expect us to access online. 
I am thinking of buying a cheap tablet to read class materials and to complete my work when I'm travelling. I find that my phone screen is way too small for this purpose.
Thank you!

Comment by ApocSanma: Theres a link on tp website with the reccomended specs for each course. For engineering courses they should reccomend high end computer i think

Comment by Vinhunter666: Hmm I know people used iPads for those learning purposes , is a good investment.For lectures are good cos they are online but not for work cos work mostly need to use laptop and hard to use a tablet to complete.

Comment by Which_Action_5554: The requirement for each course is different
Best to refer to your specific course webpage/link
Follow their recommendation, safest.

Comment by Fair_Instance_8065: for me in cen in 1.1 they forced us to get the physical notes but they are HEAVY so i really recommend getting a tablet to access the notes as its more convenient. pretty sure you are able to download lockdown browser on the tablets too to do icqs so yeah a tablet wld be a good choice.
