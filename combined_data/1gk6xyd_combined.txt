Comment by W4773N: As a LEAD student, to complete the TP LEAD programme, you’ll need to complete all 3 LEAD cores

Comment by Independent-Pop-7810: complete lead induction, lead summit and lead heart.

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: Just complete the 3 cores and you’ll be done,, other stuff all optional if you wanna attend
