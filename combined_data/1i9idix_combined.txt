Body: quick question: i might have to submit an assignment one day late, and they say they'll take off 10% of the grade. but does rhat mean they'll take 10% off the max grade (e.g. if the assignment is max 60, you can only get 54) or do they take your score and minus 10% (e.g. if you score 30/50 they'll take that and minus 10% so u get 27/50)?

Comment by InternationalArmy175: Itâ€™s from the max score. So if 50 is full marks, then minus 5.

Comment by zzzz_ee: It's from max score: if you get 30/50, it'll be 25/50 after penalty. To be sure, read the student handbook or assessment doc very carefully.

Comment by randommuserrs: im pretty sure is take ur score and minus 10%
