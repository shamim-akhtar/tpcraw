Comment by Obvious-Data1914: Sam shit here after doing the form they sent me an email saying I need provide a medical form or some colour test  in 5 working days

Comment by AlternativeBus7903: I just go an update from the email I sent to TP. regarding to my post, I am not required to do a medical exam (FYI My course is common business)

Comment by cozyunn: the zip file has the medical form and colour vision test form attached to it along with the parents acknowledgement form

email said that all tp students have to do a medical checkup but i called tpâ€™s admission office yesterday and they said my course didnâ€™t have to do one

Comment by Party-Painting5645: could you send it to me? they didnâ€™t send me a color vision test form with my zip file

Comment by cozyunn: if donâ€™t have, then you probably donâ€™t need to do the checkup. some courses arenâ€™t required to do any checkups. ( pls call tp admissions office urself to make sure because i cant guarantee ðŸ˜ž ) 

i dont have the colour vision test form so i cant send it to you ðŸ¥²
