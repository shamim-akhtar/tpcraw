Body: I just wanted to find out more about this course, as I got posted there. If any alumni or students could share more about the course, that would be really great. I want to know what the course is like and if it is stressful. Also, I don't understand how polytechnic works, so if anyone could elaborate on that, I would really appreciate it. Additionally, if anyone has information about roughly how the timetable is like ,that would be helpful too . Tysm 🙏🙏

Comment by Mean_Psychology1078: year 3 here. This course is mainly on logistics, learning warehouse management, freight calculations etc, basically everything u need to work in the logistics industry. It’s not stressful, pretty manageable if u manage yr time well. Year 2 is where all the workload comes in. Curriculum wise it’s 4 day week for me since year 2, come lesson for 2-3 hours.

Comment by jeffeen_NS: i’m a year1 here, the course at least in my first 2 semis here has been pretty chill, the time table hours are definitely less strict than other courses, most of my classes start10 am or later and have around 4-5 hour school days at most. if you wanna score really well for group projects tho i’d say you probably have to do more solo work and be more self independent on asking teachers for consult and arranging meetings. it’s not stressful if you can find a good pair of project mates fast into your sem, and be open if you want to score high cause you will have other ppl who have similar goals but won’t voice out and they would work hard with you. it’s all about trial and error at the end of the day and if you have any other qns also about the school in general and the course just pm me

Comment by Hairy-Ad8330: Uhhhh, as a person with no foundation in this course, can you recommend some preparation or things I could learn to prepare myself for the course?
