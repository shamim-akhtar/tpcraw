Comment by Alpha-232: Did you book the facility in advance?

Comment by iamnothingbuta: did you give them your id

Comment by AlfieWo: Seriously these staff have no big achievements in life. So when they seemingly have authority, they power trip. Remember don't be like these people when you grow up...

Comment by CorrectWalrus9736: yep booked it like last week

Comment by CorrectWalrus9736: yep

Comment by Alpha-232: I think it should be fine since the staff was just checking, and I am pretty sure the campus is open to the public, so bringing your friends should not result in any punishment.

Comment by CorrectWalrus9736: but the facilty (futsal field) say only open to tp staff and students only which means no outsiders allowed

Comment by Alpha-232: Oh really I didn't know about that. Hopefully they let you go this time if you explain to them not to repeat again, but the worst case will be a warning letter.
