Body: I have heard of some things in poly that is different from secondary school. That includes having weird if not bizarre or interesting CCAs ever like Japanese club (hearing it being the most weird people there), Business studies club, life saving etc. So I'm just curious to ask, what is the weirdest or the most interesting CCA in your opinion?

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Biz studies club isnt weirdâ€¦ we have it for other academic schools like design, IIT, ASC, etc haha. Tbh, stargazers was a little out of the blue as it is a newly introduced CCA.

Comment by Longjumping-Load-164: I see, I placed weird cause I heard weird stories from the Japanese club hehe, but business studies sounds quite interesting, stargazers too!
