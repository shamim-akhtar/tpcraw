Body: will tp kick me out if i fail math and finance by like 1-2 marks? i’m actually cooked and i don’t want to fail i actually really wanna study law but math and finance is actually my downfall
how strict are they in terms of kicking students out?
if it helps my attendance is 100% (the bar is so low)

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: fail even by 1 mark in pfp = gg

on politemall under each subject there should be something showing the weightage of all the things you've done over the semester like term test, class part, etc

just take a look at that, then add up all the percentages you've got so far and use that as a rough estimation of how many marks you need to score for the sem test

Comment by trippycrisis: i mean, currently i’m not really at a risk of failing finance (hopefully) and math i need 55% for my final paper to pass

Comment by AtomZones: what in the actual !

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Ex pfp student. Math finals are easier than term test just saying. 2 hours is a lot of time to think so just fully utilize it. My term test was a B and Final was a high A
