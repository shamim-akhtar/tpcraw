Body: I lowkey regretted EAEing to common ICT because my results were a lot better than I thought it would be but oh well..

Anyways, in the last hour I've seen a lot of complaints about IIT which is off-putting but it is what it is. Since I'm about to be a y1 in a couple of months from now.. what should I be expecting and how do I prepare?

Comment by mount2010: Btw don't worry too much about the complaints, I think they readjusted the syllabus until it was too easy and led to students being unprepared after the previous batch had a lot of trouble with the basic subjects (what I heard from word of mouth anyway). 

Hopefully they'll listen to our feedback and make the changes though. The school architecture is old but it's not terrible or dirty or anything, just a bit dated and the accessibility is not great (get ready to do physical exercise climbing up the IIT stairs üëç) - we only have two lifts for four blocks times 5 levels full of students

As for what to prepare, refer to the other student's comment, but don't need to worry about it too much. If you are new to programming and technology, learning python would help a lot - learn about variables, loops, and the different types of data and how to manipulate them. (still applicable in the AI age)

Comment by None: There is not much to prepare but you can start by messing around with figma , Microsoft power BI , Knime  and learning python.

Comment by Equivalent-Ride8136: Ah that's good to know. My classrooms has always been at level 4 since sec 1 so I guess I'm used to stairs üòû

Comment by Equivalent-Ride8136: Ah well I got python down for a while now I'll look into the rest for sure.
