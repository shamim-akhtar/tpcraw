Comment by KDS2000: I think U need career counselling. Do not recommend dropping out and quitting. Talk to your psychiatrist, you need time to adjust to the curriculum you are going through.

Comment by CornerDry1533: Relax bro.

Comment by Electronic_Field4313: Chill, life has failures, just pick yourself up and try again, you'll be alright.

Also, do you wanna go design because you have a passion for it or there's something within the design course that you won't be able to self-learn...?

Comment by Flat_Marketing5236: 
hey man i read your other posts, im planning to drop out to a different diploma as a y3 student cause my diploma makes me depressed. I also thought i could pull throughðŸ’€ and i almost did until 6month intern i couldnt fucking take it anymore. 

I think you can try to get some meds first or counselling. If those dont work honestly i would just change diplomas man, if your parents permit of course. (Alternatively you can take a gap year) 

feel free to drop me a dm if you wanna ask/vent about stuff

Edit: okay now that im reading this idk your situation so this isnt the best advice ongod but i wouldnt rule out the idea.

Comment by ssenetilop: Chill dude, just a minor speed bump. Get up and keep moving, start looking at what went wrong, learn from it, move on and avoid repeating the same mistake again.
