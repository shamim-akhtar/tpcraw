Comment by Vinhunter666: Typically in the next 3-4weeks, they will pay hopefully. This year's approval was slower.

Comment by Vinhunter666: If household income is higher u take lesser , vise versa. household income lower takes higher. The most is 2.6k and the least is $900. Depends on the tier also.
