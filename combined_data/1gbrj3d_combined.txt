Comment by Aikawa_Tofu_0240: As a HSS student, Flavours is the go to since I only have 1 hour lunch break during the busiest time of the day... And pray that 21 orders aren't in front of me when I finally make it to the cashier

Comment by IndependentNo6105: my group usually prefers either IIT or design, though sometimes we go to breadboard @ engine

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Sounds like a PFP math project

Comment by MusicianEffective244: If you‚Äôre doing Venn diagram, suggest to becareful as a lot of students to use that topic failed

Comment by Warm-Donut2570: Done!

Comment by SGSweatZ: flavours, the canteen got so much halal option

Comment by No_Astronomer2047: I'm from HSS and flavours is my go to. Honestly, I haven't been to any other food places other than design and business. Flavours is so near to my classes. I only go to business in the mornings for light snacks but now business is closed üíî

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: it is HAHAHA

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: really? could you tell me more on where they went wrong?

Comment by MusicianEffective244: It seems easy to do which is why many chose it. Problem is that when they use variables to explain the separation of entities or the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù variables, it was poorly explained and they never really considered a lot of factors. It was extremely tricky and no one in my class who did Venn diagram actually scored well.. I personally used one of the teacher‚Äôs recommended ideas and got an 18/20 for coordinate geometry. If you can‚Äôt think of an idea, don‚Äôt force it
