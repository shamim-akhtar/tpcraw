Body: Hey!ðŸ˜… So im (16m) hoping to get into Temasek poly computer engineering and I was wondering if guys in engineering courses are homophobic? For context, I dont really "act" or "look" gay (whatever that means ðŸ’€) so like the only way people can infer is through how i text(?) Or if i out right tell them. Just asking to ease my nerves cause i find it hard to make friends with guys if I know there is a high chance they are or are homophobic ðŸ˜… like bro im not into you, i just wanna be friendsðŸ˜­
_
Anyway, thanks for reading and hope to see yall in comp engineering!

Comment by Spartan_117_YJR: Idt homophobic but assholes will be assholes regardless of sexual orientation 

As my friend who came out as bi said to me, "Don't worry bro, you don't have chance with both genders"

Hope you find accepting friends in tp :)

Comment by Lukazonkx: U will probably get half half. Honestly, most people nowadays aren't even really homophonic, at least not enuf that they will legit bully u for being gay. I think even for the most intolerant ones, so long as u don't act gay can already

Comment by reapertorn: if you like those guys especially from design wear crop top and things like that people gonna gossip you but i assume youll be fine

Comment by Sea_Kale_3855: The ppl ard me mostly dgaf. Tip is to hang out with people that studies a lot and are hard working. They work too hard to even care about what gender u like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and a lot of lgbt girls that are open abt it

Comment by East-Refrigerator772: I'm entering aerospace engineering at TP this year and I sure hope the people there aren't homophobic :/
