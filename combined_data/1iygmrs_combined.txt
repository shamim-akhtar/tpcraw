Body: hi all, i received my enrolment offer for Diploma In Psychology and am a little confused‚Ä¶ Does everyone need to undergo the medical examination? Or is it select courses? Do i have to undergo it?

Thank you!

Comment by Extra-Dirt1382: hi, i think everyone has to go through a medical examination prior to enrolling, not js psych diploma, im currently in tp psych too and i did mine before i enrolled as well, just follow the medical form that they attached and fill it up, can js find ur nearest gp and get it done

Comment by smellypotato_: omg I'm in the same course as you and I'm also v confused üòì

Comment by Content_DeletERROR: All courses will need to go for a medical exam
Some courses might need more rigorous medical tests while some only need a simple medical checkup

Just follow the instructions given to you
You‚Äôll be fine!

Comment by djnr5: But they didn't attach a medical form, for me it's only the colour vision test form

Comment by CreativeEquivalent49: i only see a ‚Äòmedical background‚Äô section in the enrolment form.. but no other forms attached. Does that mean i don‚Äôt need a medical exam?
