Body: if my gpa for a module comes out to be 3.65/4. In the final results for that module would they count it as an A (4.0) or a B+ (3.5)?

as in they round up to A or round down to B+?

(sch of iit for context)

Comment by BudgetDevv: Hmm, I think the problem is that you will never know the raw score - They deliberately hide some components

Comment by lostclip: By right it's calculated by raw marks (which only the lecturers have) and then converted to a grade. They *might*  do a moderation if necessary.

Comment by Street_Musician_580: can use this link to calc! this is mainly for a rough gage of the actual gpa you will receive...

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: B+, its not easy to get an A in dsag
