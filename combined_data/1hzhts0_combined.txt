Body: I'm thinking of applying to tp fashion management and design and want to put common design programme below it so I'm able to choose fashion in year 2 if I can't go into the fashion course. I was looking through what we will learn for both courses but why both of them are learning different things in year1? i thought year 1 would learn all the same things. I need help ðŸ˜­ first pic is common design programme and second is fashion management and design.
