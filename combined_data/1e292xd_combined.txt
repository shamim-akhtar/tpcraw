Body: Hey, I've recently been shortlisted for the interview for Temasek Polytechnic's Law and Management course and want to plan for the potential questions that might be asked. I've gathered a few from the other courses, as some of my friends have already, but I'd like to get more input from Reddit, maybe even from Law students who have gone through the interview process. Any help is welcomed and I'm thankful for it! :D

Comment by dernoise: they ask u for ur opinions on various things, that's all I can remember? oh and like why u want to come law. imo, don't say u want to become lawyer or at least phrase it better if u do so, cuz poly train u for work, not become lawyer. atb OP, hope u get in 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
