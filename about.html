  <p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/main/images/image_03_2.PNG" alt="Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart</strong> provides a high-level overview of the
    sentiment breakdown across all posts within the selected date range. This chart categorizes
    sentiment into three primary groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive</strong>: Posts with favorable feedback or praise.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral</strong>: Posts that are informational or express no particular sentiment.</li>
    <li><strong>Negative</strong>: Posts expressing criticism, dissatisfaction, or negative experiences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The pie chart helps users quickly gauge the overall sentiment landscape by showing the
    proportion of each sentiment type. It is especially useful for identifying whether the
    general mood is positive, negative, or balanced. Users can apply filters to narrow down
    the data by date range or IIT-related content.
  </p>

  <h3>📈 Weighted Sentiment Breakdown Chart</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/main/images/image_05.PNG" alt="Weighted Sentiment Breakdown Chart" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Weighted Sentiment Breakdown Chart</strong> displays the
    <strong>Weighted Sentiment Scores</strong> for individual posts based on the selected filters.
    Each bar in the chart represents a post, with the score indicating how positive or negative
    the overall sentiment is.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive Bars</strong> (Green): Indicate favorable or appreciative sentiment.</li>
    <li><strong>Negative Bars</strong> (Red): Indicate critical or unfavorable sentiment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The weighted sentiment score is calculated by combining the sentiment polarity of each post
    with engagement metrics such as comments and upvotes, providing a more accurate reflection
    of popular opinion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can click on a specific bar to view detailed post information, including its title,
    summary, and related comments. Additionally, the chart supports <strong>zooming and panning</strong>,
    enabling users to explore data at various levels of detail.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/main/images/image_06.PNG" alt="Comment Sentiment Stacked Chart" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Comment Sentiment Stacked Chart</strong> provides a comprehensive view of user feedback
    by displaying <strong>positive and negative sentiments</strong> for comments on each post.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive Sentiments</strong> (Green): Reflect constructive, encouraging, or satisfied comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Negative Sentiments</strong> (Red): Indicate criticisms, frustrations, or dissatisfaction expressed in comments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This stacked chart helps identify the overall sentiment distribution across all comments for each post.
    The height of each bar indicates the total number of sentiments, making it easy to compare engagement
    levels and emotional responses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chart supports <strong>interactive zooming and panning</strong>, allowing users to closely examine
    specific posts or date ranges. Additionally, users can click on a bar to view the underlying comments
    and their detailed analysis.
  </p>

  <h3>💬 Total Comments Chart</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/main/images/image_07.PNG" alt="Total Comments Chart" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Total Comments Chart</strong> presents the total number of comments each post has received,
    visualized as a bar chart.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Taller Bars</strong>: Indicate posts with high community engagement and extensive discussions.</li>
    <li><strong>Shorter Bars</strong>: Suggest posts that received little to no attention or feedback.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This chart is particularly useful for identifying which posts have sparked the most conversation.
    By clicking on a specific bar, users can view detailed insights about the post, including its content,

  <p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shamim-akhtar/tpcraw/main/images/image_08.PNG" alt="Engagement Score Chart" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Engagement Score Chart</strong> visualizes the overall popularity and interaction level
    of each post. The <strong>Engagement Score</strong> is calculated by combining the number of upvotes
    and comments, factoring in their influence through a logarithmic scaling approach.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher Scores</strong>: Indicate posts that have generated significant discussion or received numerous upvotes.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower Scores</strong>: Suggest posts with minimal interaction or interest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This bar chart allows users to quickly identify which posts have attracted the most attention
    and engagement from the community. Each bar represents a post, with taller bars indicating higher engagement.
    The chart supports <strong>interactive zooming and panning</strong>, allowing users to closely examine
    posts from different time periods. Additionally, clicking on a bar displays detailed information about the post.
