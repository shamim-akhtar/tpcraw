    "comment": "If your final aim is to make it to uni, having 3 CCAs won\u2019t add a dent of impact. Unless it\u2019s leadership roles or you won some award under that capacity. It\u2019s fine to join CCAs in Y2, most people won\u2019t be bothered by it. If you want to earn SEAL points, just enter random talks and courses that awards it. But I don\u2019t think it has much bearings on much items. I would say just go for CCAs that is something that actually excites you or something that you enjoy. Don\u2019t join for the sake of points or peer pressure.",

    "comment": "Uni does care about CCAs btw, contrary to the other comments saying that uni doesn't. It's just how you phrase it and how much contribution you made. For example, if you plan to study psychology in uni, you can join CCAs that show your interest in psychology and apply for leadership positions which gives you the opportunity to have field work in the discipline. Unis like to see your passion for your interests as well as your ability to execute your interests. Uni also have ABA (Aptitude-Based Admission) options, but I think that's towards sports stuff. If you represent your school in various competitions and win awards, then they'll include it in your application. But overall, always maintain your GPA to the uni standards. Tbh, for the top 3 unis, you have to aim for at least a 3.6 or 3.7. if not, your chances of getting in is close to 0. Remember, you're competing with JC kids, people who finished their gap years, people who are applying again after getting rejected the previous year, and international students (idk if this is legit or not but I just include it). So having a high GPA is crucial, if you want to add some sprinkle into your portfolio, CCAs are a good choice, but work experience like internships are great! Now to answer your question, 1 CCA is enough in year 1 or throughout your entire poly years. It's just a matter of what your future goals are. Always choose quality over quantity, many CCAs don't mean that you're the best student (unless you're having leadership positions in all of them, but I doubt anyone can handle it without it affecting their GPA). There are also a lot of opportunities for you to earn SEAL points, not just in CCAs. So do look out for email blasts or events that you heard from classmates or friends. But do take note that certain activities are able to fulfill your Service points, Enrichment points, Achievement points, and Leadership points. There is also a cap limit to Service and Enrichment points, so plan carefully.",

    "comment": "Dear OP, Giving you some elderly advice from a guy in his late 20s here who had also went through poly. Screw the CCAs lah. If you want to have fun, just have one CCA will do. Seal points don\u2019t mean jack shit. Have fun in poly, for it is one of the most memorable times in your life, but always remember that you primary objective is not to socialise and have fun, but to STUDY and graduate with a respectable GPA. Trust me when I say this, your 3 years will fly past very very very fast. It did for me. Before you know it, you\u2019re y3 tomorrow and there\u2019s nothing you can do about your lousy 2.5 GPA. No Uni to go to, only can afford private Uni which costs a bomb. So please. Have fun, but study smart, study hard and focus on studies. Cheers, and all the best.",

Even if you\u2019re that interested in all 3 CCAs, you won\u2019t have the capability and capacity to participate in all to the fullest. That\u2019s just too much effort and remember you\u2019re still a student first. Unis these days are most interested in aptitude, external experience in the field like relevant internships, participation in competitions and professional accreditations. Like if I\u2019m the President of the Investment CCA and I apply for a Business course I\u2019m gonna have a higher chance of getting it then versus a student with CCAs in running, soccer, swimming. Oh and if I attended someone business case study and won something, that\u2019s gonna further cement my chances. But obviously, I would still encourage one to choose the top CCA that they have interest in, even if it won\u2019t help you directly in life later on. For most, poly could be the last time they touch a book in their life, might as well make the most of it and do something they truly enjoy.",
