    "comment": "school of business is known for being very slack (a universal experience across almost all polytechnics and universities). this is coming from a y3 BUS student btw. while ENG has about 7-8 modules per semester, BUS has about 4-5 modules excluding TPFUN modules. many of us have 1-2 days on our schedule with no classes. modules i would say are moderate difficulty. if you pay attention and participate in class, concepts won't be too difficult to understand. engineering however, can be challenging if you don't have a strong foundation in maths and/or physics. i have friends from marketing and the internship opportunities are pretty diverse, you get to choose which company to intern at. it's a 20-week internship spanning september to january. i can't say if the course is boring because i'm not from the course. my friends from marketing are all relatively high performers, but they're hardworking. i also know people from engineering who either have excellent gpas or they graduate with a 2.0 gpa. if you don't have interest or a talent in engineering, it's likely you won't end up doing well. by the way, these questions should have been considered before submitting your choices. it's gonna be really hard if you end up in a course you don't like. anyway, it's too late for regrets now. i hope you enjoy your years in tp :)",
