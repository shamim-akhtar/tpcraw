    "comment": "Someone had to say it, thank you very much. currently trying to balance the workload rn. if its safe to say, chatgpt/youtube/online resources are helping me more than the school right now. from what i know, the SLs for each individual module are appointed a few weeks before the sem starts. so they themselves would also have to throw out everything in a messy order to meet the deadline before the new sem starts. that is why you would see your lessons/practicals/labs/subject teching plan all being released on the first day of the sem when u boot up lms. though the teachers have adapted to this by slowly releasing them while the respective weeks approach. i still feel that this approach is very disorganized since it also creates this sense of urgency for them. to put ourselves in the SLs shoes, they are also struggling with this problem of meeting ridiculous deadlines so we cant blame them too much. Can also see from their facial expressions that they too want to change this systematic approach of IIT. however im sure most of you have seen from previous IIT related posts, majority of the time alumnis from many years back also complain of this approach. I am confident to say that this problem does not only occur due to the lecturers's ignorance, but also due to the upper-management not really giving a fuck about IIT. shoutout to Mr Eric from IT course tho. hes really carrying adev/dbav classes he teaches rn. He never fails to help his students understand problems and is also really helpful during consultations.",

As someone who started learning most of the things from scratch in IIT like JavaScript, it feels so rushed and they expect us to produce good quality work, when like some of these things are outdated? and projects, how do we know what to improve on if we just receive a grade? why can't we see what's wrong with our work?

    "comment": "Hey OP, I agree with much of these points you brought up. Especially for the last one, e.g. for DSAG, where most of the content is \"watch this Youtube video\". I remember one big part of COMT being requiring us to watch through a few Linkedin Learning courses about generative AI without any real point... the things in there weren't even tested. It feels like IIT lacks central coordination and quality control. I wonder what's going on in course planning. Perhaps the lecturers' decision making is too distributed? It feels like all the subject heads are doing their own things without a central plan or idea. Maybe they need to appoint someone or a committee to oversee the other subjects. Hopefully they can improve the school before we graduate lol... Ngl it feels hopeless - I don't feel like I'm being prepared for an industry which is being quickly shaken up by generative AI. We didn't pay school fees for the lecturers to teach us about methods that are 6 years old at best, so yeah... It's crazy too, the other schools seem fine, so I wonder what's going on in IIT.",

    "comment": "It's really crazy how I've seen labs that came from 2016 before. 9 years ago, really? How much has technology advanced over the course of that time? Can the lecturers really look us in the eye and tell us that technology is the same as it was 9 years ago? It also off putting at how some of the lecturers get annoyed when we don't understand the lessons they taught. They take such long times to teach topics that are simpler, and little to no time teaching the harder ones. If we can't understand it, doesn't that tell you that you should try changing your teaching methods? Not only that but when we come up to them to ask for comments, and they sigh in distress due to us getting that area wrong, it really makes the students disheartened. Adding on with them telling us they've taught this and asking why we don't understand it, it just makes the students not feel like going to them for help the next time they encounter problems, and go to YouTube tutorials and chatgpt instead. I really hoped that they would\u2019ve done sem 2 better after what most people have definitely complained/ given feedback on in the Tessy from the end of sem 1. However, I\u2019m sure they planned ahead for the whole year already from the beginning, so I guess I can\u2019t pray for much to be done. I do still hope that after this semester, that the heads actually look through the comments given and work on improving the schedule for the future years and new batches of students coming in soon.",

Rather, they should teach how to step through code with the debugger, it is much more useful when it comes to debugging code.

    "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m from school of applied science here. Thanks for sharing more about your experience in IIT. I just want to comment on 3 points: 1.  ADEV consultation - I do agree that everyone in every class gets equal opportunity or rights to ask questions that they feel concern about in the project. Lecturers should be practiced to be open than to practice favourism. 2. No Feedback on projects - I agree and disagree on certain extend. If the project does not affect you in the future modules e.g. if you are doing global studies project , you wouldn\u2019t need to receive feedback because all you have to do is to have a basic understanding. But if the project does affect you in the future modules . For example , if you study a fundamental core module in year 1 which would carry in year 2, then yes you would definitely need feedback to improve your skills. 3. YouTube as a Teacher. I have to 100% agree with your statement for the fact that you are attending an institution to be lectured by your lecturer on the topics that you guys learn and if you come to class just being told by your lecturer to watch a YouTube video by a random user , it\u2019s absolutely bullshit. I just want to support your reasoning that what if the content that is provided by YouTube is unreliable and cause misinformation ? What if the things that is being learnt through YouTube would cause potential hazards e.g. typing a code that would cause your computer to blackout . Though I must say that I am of different school than the people in IIT, I am really proud that you people of IIT have a forward mindset and passion driven. I hope that your school really take your feedback seriously and Improve the condition.",
