It was like mcq questions regarding the current economic situation, what\u2019s the capital city of a certain country, and who\u2019s the president of a country. They asked two open ended questions that year, which was on AI. One of it I could rmb clearly, it is \u201cdo you think AI would replace accountants in the future\u201d The questions are kind of randomized cuz I asked my friends and they got different questions from me, but quite similar ones. anyways good luck for ur aptitude test. Jia you!",
