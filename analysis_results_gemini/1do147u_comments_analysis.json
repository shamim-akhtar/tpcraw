Each sport will last 3 lessons (3 weeks) (less if clash with holiday). And yes it is vv similar to sec sch pe except they teach u every sport from the basics. (Like for badminton theyll teach u how to hold a racket, how to serve and how to juggle the shuttlecock). As for ur senior, he prob skipped too many lessons which led him to fail that module so he had to retake in y2.",
