    "comment": "Hi there , I have dealt with CICT before last year . To answer your question, CICT is a pass or fail so actually no exact marks would be given for your assignments , so you just need to pass that\u2019s all . And the word \u201cinsightful analysis\u201d could mean that you have done well . In other words , what you have done in your assignment is already good enough . Cause for your assignment 1 is involving CRAAP test right ? So that means you have applied the use of the method really well . So nothing much to improve unless you at certain point have questions about the CRAAP Test which may affect in your next assignment.",
