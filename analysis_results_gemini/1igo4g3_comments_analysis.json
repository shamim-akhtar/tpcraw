For them, a \"no\" is a starting point for negotiation, its fuel for them, so the only way is to IGNORE completely and go to authorities. Enough of reports with sufficient supporting evidence of your concerns or going to media will force the school to react ultimately, but i hope he will get the proper psych help.",

    "comment": "Your comment here is utterly laughable at the way its presented. Imagine being dissmissive, accustory and thinking you hold the moral high ground in a case that has nothing to do with you. Let's break down your response ja? \"This is cyberbul\u00f6ying\" No it is not. Holding someone accountable for their actions backed by reliable evidence is not cyberbullying. \"where are the victim\u2019s testimonies?\" As with many cases regarding SA/P\u00e4dophile, many victims may not feel safe nor comfortable in sharing their experiences first hand, and may rely on a third party to do so. Your comment here disregards the complexities of trauma and whatnot, and instead insists that you have a lack of empathy or understanding to victims and the gravity of such situations. \"That\u2019s why there are many suicides and depression out there.\" In this statment we see that you completely miss the point of what depression is. You claim that many who are depressed are because they are victims of false accusations. No. I dont think I even need to explain how complex and different depression can be for everyone. This really just shows how shallow and insensitive your thinking is. Other misc stuff If you wanted people to engage with a discussion, perhaps work on your tone. Your tone actively allianates others by the sheer lack of understanding and the impression that you are better than others. TLDR do better throwaway account",
