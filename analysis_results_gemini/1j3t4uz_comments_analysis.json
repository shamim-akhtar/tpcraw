If asking seniors for guidance is a crime, I guess mentorship, teamwork, and basic human decency must be obsolete concepts in your world. Keep flexing that 'resourcefulness'.

Anyway, there's no wrong or right way to be resourceful. Asking seniors can be helpful when you want a deeper understanding of what is going on in the subject rather than the broad summary or what's on the school website. Asking seniors is also being resourceful. No need to be so critical about it. If you got nothing good and nice to say, don't say. You may not need extra academic lessons, but please learn to be a more civil person. You may never know who you are dealing with.",
