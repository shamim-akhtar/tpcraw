I\u2019m sure there are many talented artists within the school who would be more than willing to contribute their work to make the spaces more visually appealing. Not only would it add a personal touch, but it would also give credit to those students, showcasing their talent. It could be a great way for TP to highlight its creative students, instead of relying on generic, soulless AI prompts.",

About the study area, I AGREE also! I wish we were given a specific area too. It would be more private for us IIT students and more accessible.",
