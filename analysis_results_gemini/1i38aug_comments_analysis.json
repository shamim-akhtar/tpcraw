There are some lecturers who are really enthusiastic and makes the module really fun to learn. 4) it depends because i get to choose my own group mates. but yeah if you get grouped with those lazy ones then be prepared to work your ass off.",

    "comment": "oh ya and if your planning to get the certificate of recognition (COR), your MCs and LOA won\u2019t cover your SAR-147 hours it\u2019ll only cover the TP attendance system. So let\u2019s say i take an MC on Monday where it contributes to 3 hours of SAR attendance, if you see on the TPOSS website, your attendance will still be 100% because the MC covers it but at the SAR attendance website it\u2019ll show that you\u2019ve lost some hours. Yeah just keep that in mind.",

    "comment": "I'm not from ENG but regarding the device to buy, there are highly recommended specs from TP here: https://www.tp.edu.sg/life-at-tp/tp-students-digital-access-it-matters/students-it-needs.html Since Aerospace is under one of the \"required to own high-end Windows laptops\" diplomas, it might be good to buy one with the specs listed here or buy from the recommended models by the school. If you need financial assistance consider applying for the BYOD FAS (they will either reimburse your laptop purchase or give you a laptop for a smaller charge). Though I have to say, that takes a few months, so you may want to have a temporary device ready in the interim. I have classmates that use computers that didn't match the course specifications and they are suffering a bit, so I would recommend not ignoring this",
