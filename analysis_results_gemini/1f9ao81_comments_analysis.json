    "comment": "The reality is that most of your classmates are bad at coding. Real coding. Most would fail a real quiz or exam, or projects where they can't get code online or from Chat GPT. You need to: Pay attention in class, and do your practical work diligently. Don't sleep, stare at the ceiling, text your friends, watch videos, or whatever. If you don't have enough self discipline, put your phone in your bag and keep it there. Ask your tutor when you don't understand something, and use Chat GPT to explain concepts (not give you answers!). You can ask Chat GPT for code, but make sure you get it to explain and comment the code, then ask you questions about it afterwards. Don't ask your friends for answers or code. Try to figure things out for yourself. The final code isn't really so important. It's the figuring out that matters (that will eventually translate to better grades) Make sure you understand all the basic concepts: variables, variable scope, data types, control structures (if, for, while), functions, data structures (arrays, lists), core OOP concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, etc.), and so on. Take it seriously. Don't spend all of your \"free\" time playing games or doom-scrolling. Don't think of learning as a chore. Be thankful that you live such a privileged life (compared to most people in other countries) that you can spend three years learning at a world class educational institute. Borrow a textbook from the library. Textbooks tend to lead you in a structured way, so you'll have more guidance than with fragmented web pages. If you really can't read, find a reputable YouTube playlist that starts from the basics to more complex concepts. Don't expect it to be easy! As I said, most of your classmates aren't as good as you think they are, whatever their grades (though a few will be). Work hard! Don't give up. Eventually it will click and start to be fun.",

    "comment": "Hey, was from TP IIT as well. I gotta admit, it seems like you guys are getting it harder from the time I graduated (2 years back) and now. COMT was just us building an android app \ud83d\ude02 But anyway, what I would wanna say is to do well in tech (or perhaps anything hands on) is just to practice, practice practice. You gotta do it till it becomes muscle memory for you to truly do well. You can think of programming/coding as learning an actual new language like Chinese Malay etc. And definitely the process is tough. But after you\u2019ve been in here for some time, it\u2019ll definitely ease in and be easier Do not beat yourself up for the first semester. My Y1S1 results were the worst across my semesters. Take it as a learning point, and do well for the next. Perhaps what you can do is to really give yourself a headstart by reading up what you\u2019ll be doing next semester during the holidays. For example, if you\u2019re doing web dev next sem, you can look at HTML/CSS/JS from websites like w3schools. The learning process may be slower, but what matters is that we are patient with it. Spend some time everyday after class to program, and slowly you\u2019ll be able to get it. All the best!",
