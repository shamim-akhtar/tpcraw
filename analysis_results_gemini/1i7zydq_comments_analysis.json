    "comment": "If it helps you feel better, I would have had a cGPA around the 3.9 range if I didn't fail my communication modules. Now it is pretty subpar. Failing also meant I am no longer eligible for d-list / DWM. I do feel you - My peers seem to be steadily improving their GPA, while mine looks like a y = mx + b downward slope, thanks to irrelevant modules I didn't sign up for. Grades for communication modules are also heavily dependent on the lecturer. It did drain me, of course. For a good moment, I lost my drive to do my assignments, which snowballed into late submissions. Eventually, I realized my drive to do well wasn't confined to just grades, but a genuine passion for the subjects and desire to learn and explore more. Perhaps unsolicited advice, but use self-improvement as a metric instead of compare and contrast with peers. The irony of programming ( And many other things ) is that the more you know, the lesser you feel. May your passion for IT last!",

    "comment": "Part of it is also that for O level students poly is a total reset if you have no background in your course, you go from doing something you've gotten used to for 10 years (e.g. math, english, whatever) to something completely new for grades. So yeah, for many of you it's your first time encountering such things, don't take it too hard, take it as a learning experience. Jiayou!",

I know you may not like this, but think about how much time you have spent on gadgets since joining Poly. Improved time management will benefit you; this will serve as a learning exercise on what could have been done better. I hope you gain self-awareness and excel in the upcoming semesters.",
