For our daily student life, I would just say is pretty much the same for all polytechnic students. We have very flexible timetables, it can vary from 9am,11am or even 2pm for us. There will be 1-2 days where we have no school weekly. (depends on what academic school you are in though. Sometimes you don't have that)",
