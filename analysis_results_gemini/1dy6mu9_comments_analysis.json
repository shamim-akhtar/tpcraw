    "comment": "got in through eae last year, for the test they have some math questions, riddles and english language questions. almost all questions are mcq, except for the last question which was open-ended. when i took it, the question was : does business ethics play an important role in running a business? or something along those lines. you only have 1 hour to complete it for the interview they asked pretty basic questions. why are you interested in this diploma, why tp over other polys, do you have any prior experiences related to business. the most difficult questions they asked were : name a local business person that inspires you,  use a sheet of paper and illustrate/draw how you would deal with opposing opinions. also, you'll probably be in a room with around 3 other applicants. this was last year so this year might or might not be similar. good luck on ur eae",
