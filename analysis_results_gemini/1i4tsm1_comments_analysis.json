If u have grp projs, try ur best to make sure ur teammates do their work (if they are able to get it done much more quicker, it will be good bcs u can spend more time revising). Everyday, make sure to at least try study for 30 mins, being it making notes/rewatching recorded tut vids etc bc trust, it\u2019ll definitely help rather than trying to cramp everyt the week before term test. If you have multiple projs assign, try to get some parts done first in the diff projs. also!!! i rely on ytb for understanding certain concepts like Khan academy, Organic chem tutor.. their teaching style may be helpful and simpler to understand the content! atb!! jiayou u can do it\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

    "comment": "Hi there, i understand how you feel. For projects and assignment TPFUN subjects like  Ecom or Global Studies , it\u2019s manageable as long as you attend to class every day and follow along with your lecturers on what to do . But for projects that takes your time most of the time like NUH and INNOVA project right , i guess one way to deal with it is to organize a meeting with your group to work on the project progressively . For core modules, I wrote my own notes for NuH and CBB and sometimes I just copy and paste some slides into my notes and just annotate them. For stats, I just use excel to help me with my calculation and just apply my learnings from there .",

Currently this semester, the commitment is so much that I keep thinking about the project . And plus I only have like 2 days to study for a particular module just to pass the test.",
