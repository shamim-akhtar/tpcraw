    "comment": "Interned at one of the big 4. I can just feel the toxicity emanating from the partners from 7am onwards everyday. Turnover for my dept was extremely high. Almost 90% of the people i worked with excluding interns left the year after they got their bonus. Although you are an intern and the expectation of you is pretty low, the moment you take a look at your colleagues and managers around you, I think you would re evaluate your choices of pursuing a career in this field. Almost most of the partners have health issues advancing that far in to their career. I once saw my boss using cold water instead of boiling water for her cup noodles just to \u201csave time\u201d like wtf? Some antics are really hard to forget considering she is worth like 20-30m (Im avoiding specifics lol) \u201cIf it is your problem, you better make it everyone\u2019s problem to solve the problem faster\u201d - partner (those who are in the dept will know of this commonly used phrase) \u201cSupervision is a burden\u201d - my supervisor",
