For Engineering maths 1, they did stuff like limits, algebra, geometry etc. For EM2, its all calculus like differentiation, integration etc. But its all super basic level.

    "comment": "Fresh AMS Graduate. EM was a mixed of O Level A Math and JC Math. Plentiful of resources and additional support such as Learning Support Group that takes place out of lessons with the module head. I had a fellow classmate from ITE in a similar position as you and he managed to pass EM as well. That being said, EM is a core module, hence you need to retake if you fail to fulfil graduation requirement. Hope this helps! Edit: typo",

Whereas for data visualisation and analysis, it's a continuation of both computing and QMethods. You will take this in year 2 so don't worry too much about it. If you have any basic computing skills it will definitely help, but if you don't have any it's okay",
