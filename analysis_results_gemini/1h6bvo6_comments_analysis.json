DSAG taking three whole weeks to go through variables logic and functions again is hilarious Tbh the timetable needs to be tighter at the start of sems and lighter at the end of sems during assignment periods",

The point I was trying to articulate is, perhaps their expectation stem from the fact that decent looking sites can be achieved with readily available CSS / UI libs. The labsheets seem to support the sentiment, with the better looking ones leveraging bootstrap with very minimal handwritten CSS. They do not seem to dive in-depth with CSS as well, at least in my current course of study.",

The good news is that such restrictions are typically relaxed Y2 onwards.",

NECT really varies from lecturer based on what i've observed anyway. but the workload is pretty manageable and studying the content helps a lot lol",
