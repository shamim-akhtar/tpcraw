    "comment": "Yep for students in common programs they'll get to choose their diploma of specialisation after one Sem(what's offered by the school so in your case architecture) It's based on how well she performs in Sem 1, but typically you'll get within your first 3 choices if you don't perform extraordinarily bad. For the first year all students of that school have the same modules which you can find on the school site :) Goodluck to your daughter hope she enjoys being in TP :)",
