    "comment": "Btw don't worry too much about the complaints, I think they readjusted the syllabus until it was too easy and led to students being unprepared after the previous batch had a lot of trouble with the basic subjects (what I heard from word of mouth anyway). Hopefully they'll listen to our feedback and make the changes though. The school architecture is old but it's not terrible or dirty or anything, just a bit dated and the accessibility is not great (get ready to do physical exercise climbing up the IIT stairs \ud83d\udc4d) - we only have two lifts for four blocks times 5 levels full of students As for what to prepare, refer to the other student's comment, but don't need to worry about it too much. If you are new to programming and technology, learning python would help a lot - learn about variables, loops, and the different types of data and how to manipulate them. (still applicable in the AI age)",
