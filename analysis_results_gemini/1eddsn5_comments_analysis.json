For setting up of FTP Site, do only till step 2. Please understand that you can't copy entirely there are some parts where you need to improvise. Here are some things to take note: Make sure your up address is correct Make sure you have created your cert and used the correct one Make sure your firewall is configured to allow ftp (hint: firewall support & inbound firewall) Make sure your winscp is installed properly, when connecting make sure it's the correct up address, username and password MOST IMPORTANTLY: please make sure you have not done ur CIS benchmark rectification. Or else none of this will work and you will need a new vm. Hope this helps :) Good luck!!",
