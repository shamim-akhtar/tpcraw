    "comment": "Please refer to this page: https://www.tp.edu.sg/life-at-tp/tp-students-digital-access-it-matters/students-it-needs.html Yes, you can apply for financial subsidy for the device if you have been approved for government bursary. There are two plans, one where you buy and they reimburse later, and one where you pay a lower fee and the school chooses the model (no options). Personally I went for the latter and the model they chose is pretty solid and exceeds most expectations.",

    "comment": "No restrictions at all apart from needing to download Lockdown Browser for quizzes and tests (from what I see, lockdown browser clears itself completely after you exit). I'd recommend against accepting any \"allow your organization to manage your device\" prompts (e.g. when signing into Microsoft apps) since that might change settings on your laptop. But other than that I don't think TP cares what you do on your laptop. Also the school wifi blocks the usual suspects and games but that's about it.",
