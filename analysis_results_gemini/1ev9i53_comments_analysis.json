For example , cluster 1 is your class , cluster 2 is other diploma classes . If you are coming from the main gate , you have to walk all the way to the end of the school of business building, turn left , enter the door on the left at auditorium 3 , walk straight, turn right and turn left till you see an elevator and that\u2019s where the sports hall is . If you are coming from the East Gate, you would have to walk from the School of Humanities, and you should notice a building straight saying \u201csports and art centre , 26A\u201d . Take the lift up to the sports hall (there\u2019s a sign on the lift) .",
