    "comment": "1. More towards portfolio 2. What is more important is your CGPA, as university look out for CGPA more than SEAL points. For SEAL points, you definitely will get service seal points when you do CCN day & LEADACT and enrichment SEAL points by signing up for events which u can check ur outlook. From point 3, if u do get a main comm role, you\u2019ll easily get 20 SEAL points under leadership, and also more SEAL points under service if the CCA you\u2019re main comm in let\u2019s you organise events. And if you are a class rep, that\u2019s another 20 SEAL points under leadership. 3. Nothing much to worry as you can join a CCA whenever you like, whether in Y1, Y2 or even Y3. Though if you are looking for main comm roles you might be at a slight disadvantage as for some CCA u need to be in the CCA for one year, that means u would have a chance to be a main comm only in Y3, but in Y3 u\u2019re likely to be busy cuz of MP and SIP.",
