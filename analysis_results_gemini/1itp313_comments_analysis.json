    "comment": "Hi! Unfortunately, it's going to be really tough if you don't have much background in computers. I don't think TP does enough for this demographic. I would recommend looking up some basic technological literacy guides -- how to use folders and files, how to organize your folders, how to unzip a file, basic command line terminal literacy (how to use `cd`, `ls`, `mv` and execute programs in Powershell etc), how to install/uninstall programs, how to identify safe websites for downloading programs, etc. Learning basic Git also will help with some projects. With anything computers and IT, playing around with it matters the most. Try to do new (or even impossible-sounding) things and see where you go. It's almost impossible to learn how to do most IT things from school alone due to the depth of the subject. As for directly related to school topics, start by watching the Y1S1 videos here: https://tp-itsig.github.io/#/ In addition, as with anything related to school, listen to the lecturers and pay attention during class!",

    "comment": "as a Y2 CDF student, any advice from any IT student for Y1 will be very helpful since we all learn the same things then. Y2 is when you'll start learning things specialised for your course, so I'll give you some advice for that period instead. for the technical side of things, I highly recommend learning the basics of linux and playing around with it. It's a whole different operating system from windows, so it might sound a bit scary, but you can use it without worrying about breaking your laptop using virtual machines (VMs). You can think of VMs as mini computers running inside your actual computer. If you break something in a VM, you can easily revert it to a previous state using snapshots. We use virtualbox for our VM shenanigans, so that's what you'll want to download. Now for how you should approach Y2, ESPECIALLY sem 2, you NEED to lock in hard. Like seriously start doing projects as early as possible, doesn't matter if your lecturer hasn't taught you everything you need to know, just do the project alongside the labs. Don't be like me just settling into a slow comfortable pace, which left me and my groupmates 3 weeks or less to finish 3 hard projects with 2(?) assessments in between, then after that another week to finish 1 more hard project, and after all that I'm left with 4 days to revise 17 weeks worth of content for a test. That test is tomorrow and I've only fully covered 3 weeks of content \ud83d\udc80",

    "comment": "For basics, learn: - * How to use Microsoft Word and Powerpoint efficiently (learn to use styles, page breaks, and references at bare minimum). * how to always be hands on with learning. cybersecurity is not something you can learn solely through theory. Watch a youtube video, but do it alongside the video. * Learn how to search for instructions/guides on Google effectively, and skim through a whole article before following. This will be an important skill throughout your course and future career. * as mount2010 said, get comfortable with unconventional ways to use a computer such as the command line. * if you really want to, learn how to install an operating system on a virtualisation software like Oracle VirtualBox. Install something like Ubuntu and learn to navigate and operate a Linux machine. * Unlearn trigger happiness. I.e. check/think before you click on something. I have seen someone accidentally re-installing his Windows because hedouble-clicked on a Windows ISO file (mounts it, and opens the folder), then clicked on Setup.exe and clicked Next all the way. This resinstalled his Windows and he lost all his files.. :/",

    "comment": "hi im a common ict student who will be starting cdf this april. ive read all the comments and they are very helpful. however most of it is catered towards what u will be learning in year 2 instead of year 1. like what someone said already, y1 everyone will be learning the same thing regardless of ur diploma. so i think it is bttr to focus on y1 than y2 first. we dont touch linux at all in y1 as far as i rmb so maybe hold off on that for now and focus on y1 first! :) y1 sem 1 subjects : Computatitional Thinking (COMT), LOMA (Logics & Maths i think), UXID (User Experience & Interface Design), CYFUN (Cybersecurity Fundamentals), DAVA (Data Visualisation & Analytics). - COMT : Uses python as the main programming language. Basically teaches u on python fundamentals etc. Wld be really helpful if u try learning python first as in year 1, u will be learning python a lot. - LOMA : Tbh feels like amaths in o levels. if u struggle with maths then my advice wld be to study and practice a lot. most of my o level classmates did well though. - UXID : we made an app prototype using a software called Figma or Axure RP. teaches u importance of user experience in design. - CYFUN : teaches you cybersecurity fundamentals and how to use some windows features. my lecturer went thru labs and then our exam and projects wld be somewhat based on those labs so u shld ask questions if u are unsure. - DAVA : uses Microsoft Power BI and KNIME to teach u to analyse datasets. personally i hated this module the most haha but some of my classmates liked it. it helps if u get a quickstart on learning what each node is for :)",

    "comment": "for y1 sem 2, NECT (Networking Technology?), ADEV (App Development), DBAV (Database smth), DSAG (Data Structures & Algorithms). - NECT : uses cisco packet tracer. honestly its the module that has the least resources & teaching practical wise and most of my cohort struggled due to this very reason. it was mostly self study/researching. wld help u a lot if u watch videos or experiment with the app bcoz u will learn how to do basic networking on it. we had to create an office networking environment from scratch for 1 individual project, and another grp project. we also had to dabble on aws abit but its more theory based. - ADEV & DBAV : 2 modules that they combine into 1 for projects and tests. but both are graded differently, meaning have different components & weightage for each. ADEV is more on frontend development while DBAV is backend. ADEV focuses on javascript, html, css. while DBAV is mysql. would do u good to learn all 4 languages during ur sem vacation in sep-oct period. would help u a lot. we had to create websites from scratch for 2 projects, but 1 project only the design while the 2nd one had to be a fully working one linked to ur database. i hated adev dbav and it gave everyone the most stress haha. - DSAG : it's like a continuation of COMT where u js learn python but u will learn more python codes and stuff. All in all, focus on sem 1 for year 1 first. 1st sem's gpa will be the most important towards ur cumulative gpa (ur total gpa throughout ur whole 3 yrs in poly) bcoz it will be rlly hard to pull up ur gpa if u start with a low one, especially if u want to go to uni. dont be like me and procrastinate till last minute to start on projects. the moment u get ur project requirements, work on them asap bcoz like someone else here said, u will have little time for ur tests later on to study. finding good classmates to study with is also important bcoz they will be supporting u and u can learn from them as well, so both can help each other. ask questions to ur lecturer whenever u dont understand smth and go for as many consultations if u can, especially in sem 2. all the best!! hope this helps :)",
