    "comment": "Why not try outside of TP ? You can try Thai food at Soi Thai Kitchen . They have lunch sets that you can choose from . You also try gelatos at Hundred Acre too and my recommended ice cream flavour would be the peanut butter banana . There\u2019s also like hotpot buffets that have student price near restaurants I have mentioned and Izakaya restaurants too . You can also get bubble teas at ITea there too nearby.  While I get that it is slightly expensive than what you normally have in TP , it is worth your appetite.",
