    "comment": "Hi, if you got 0.92, it means that you really are struggling. Think about why you got this GPA in the first place. Is it because of your study habits? Have you been paying attention in class? Do you understand the concepts taught in lectures and tutorials? If not, maybe you should really reconsider your learning habits now. You should clarify concepts with your tutors in your tutorials, and diligently do your tutorials before class. Ensure you have a good grasp of the material taught in class. 0.92 means that you have probably failed multiple modules \u2013 and you\u2019re just Year 1 (Sem 1 if I\u2019m not wrong). The modules will get more complex as the semesters go by, so if you are failing Y1S1, you probably won\u2019t have much luck in the next semesters if you don\u2019t seriously change your study habits and your attitude. I really mean no offence to you in my comment, and I genuinely wish for you to improve. Even if you get perfect 4.0 for the remaining semesters I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to achieve anything above 3.0 (I\u2018m not sure \u2013 maybe max you can get is around high 2??? sorry I don\u2019t have a calculator). Anyway, I wish you all the best in your studies, and don\u2019t give up! Sincerely, a Y2 \ud83d\ude0a",

    "comment": "When I first read this, I was very confused how you can get 0.92 gpa, cause if you pass all of your modules, minimum should be gpa of 1. GPA below 1 is really concerning because I think that something within your module is lacking and you really need to  push yourself even harder in adapting to the learning environment while catching up your studies before the assessments. So my advice to you in your next semester is as follow: 1. Avoid applying for part-time jobs during school term as you need to focus on your studies. If you really do have financial issues, do speak to a counsellor about financial issues and the school would see what they can help you. 2. Plan your schedules and set your priorities of work based on importance and urgency. 3. Consult with your lecturers if you do not get what is being taught in a particular topic and do get feedback to help yourself improve. 4. Do not just read from the lecture notes, but also be able to convey the same idea through writing of your own notes, be vocal to yourself (e.g. do a self lecture by going through the slides - I know it's embarrassing but think of it as like you doing the presentation and a rehearsal) and be proactive some ways that would keep you motivated to study more. 5. \\[Very Important\\] Your style of learning is different from everyone and you have to find your own style of learning to become an effective learner. Be yourself! While you are still year 1, I want to tell you that the future years of your academic will be even tougher and this is what year 1 stuff is training you. So do your best, persevere and all the best in your future endeavours!",

    "comment": "Hey. TP Grad here Yeah, 0.92 GPA is really, kinda shocking. I think the main question is asking yourself about the methods you are implementing in your modules Are the modules project based? Exams based? Usually if they are project based you\u2019ll have to plan your time better as you need time to complete them (same as a group project) If they are exam based and assuming they have no projects, you should still study quite regularly to prevent yourself from cramping everything at the last minute Habits is honestly, just try to at least study/look through the content taught in school daily. Start by 1-2 hours a day and you\u2019ll definitely see some form of improvement. However, to address the GPA that you\u2019re getting, I think the main question to ask yourself is, do you like whatever you are doing? Can you do this? Or do you absolutely hate it? If you like whatever you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re able to manage, you just need a change of methods of studying and be consistent. But, if you hate whatever you are doing, I\u2019ll recommend for you to drop out Had a classmate back then who failed every single mod in Year 1 and only passed SNW \ud83d\udc80. Dropped out the next sem. So, ask yourself, do you think you like what you are doing?",

I was from ITE because I flung my Os with a total of 33 points. I regretted a lot because I was lazy. I got back on my feet when I reached ITE. I'm not someone who is good at studying, not \u8bfb\u4e66\u6599 coz I take a long time and have a hard time understanding things. But I worked hard to at least have a pass. I scored about 2.3 which allowed me to get into poly thu EAE. Year 1 poly I flung math and had to retake this module. I didn't take A-math in poly, and the math in poly requires A math. I had 0 idea what the teacher was talking about. So Y1 Sem 2 on top of the extra math module I had to take, the rest of the sem 2 modules continue on. It was very tough. I would look out the window of my room and just cry, and cry sitting in the corner of my room. But I held on, found myself a tutor, and worked my s off. I finally managed to get it from an F to C grade. So, my experience is just to hopefully motivate you study. Please put in effort. Although it looks like there's no hope now, just do the best within your ability right now. You need to push yourself. The sweetness that comes out of your hardwork, is unimaginably sweet. I felt that when I saw my math grade jumped from F to C, for someone like me who is not study material and with no A math background.",

You have been fooling too much and never submit your assignments/projects on time. Talk to your parents if they want to let you try for another 1 more semester. Personally, with a 0.92 GPA, I do not know how are you going to pull the your remaining 2.5 years to a 4.0 GPA. Even if you get 3.0 GPA for the next 2.5 years, your 0.92 GPA will pull your GPA to around GPA 2.65. Might not even be enough for you to qualify for any local university. This is the worst case scenario. I feel you can start applying for DAE or ask for internal transfer in TP to reset your GPA. If you do not want to go local university and don't mind private university, u can continue to stay on. Source: When I was in polytechnic Y1 i flunked super badly and my GPA was 0.

    "comment": "I repeated poly for one year and graduated with a GPA of 1.8. Since year 1 I had 0 interest in the course but wasn\u2019t able to change due to my poor o level results. Looking back I think having zero interest was just an excuse I gave myself cuz I know of a lot of people that didn\u2019t had interest but they still managed to be quite decent in their grades. After a couple of years I managed to get into a private university and got myself a gpa of 3.4 (not the best but coming from a 1.8 gpa in poly I kinda surprised myself) There were a few things I did differently in Uni as compared to poly that I hope it can help. 1. Change of environment I couldn\u2019t study at home because my gaming PC was just beside me and it was a major distraction. Instead I went to libraries or cafes and stuff my phone deep inside my bag and put it in airplane mode. This allowed me to focus better. 2. Using mind map I used mind map to first map out all the topics from macro to micro. This enabled me to first understand what the heck the module is talking about before I dive into the textbook. In poly, I used to just scribble and highlight notes in my textbook but realise I can\u2019t remember anything. 3. Simplify what you learn so that a kid can understand it. After you go through a chapter, try to explain it to yourself or other people like they are kids. Keep it simple and don\u2019t try to use fancy terms. Looking back I realised how easy it was for me to do well in poly but I just gave myself the excuse that I\u2019m not interested in the subject. Since I was already in it I might as well do my best.
