What happens when the costs increase, what will happen to you... more work? Doing multiple menial jobs is not the way. Some suggestions: Ask the government for support Have your care person help with administration for funding. Take secured bank loans to at least finish school Work study program",

    "comment": "Hi there, I am really sorry to hear about the situation that you are in. I just want to share with you some experience in any institution in general even in ITE . I got some friends who actually enroll in ITE and they suddenly quit after like after year 1 semester 1 due to several reasons that I have heard such as academic issues, family issues or even personal issues. And I just want to say that dropping out of school just makes you lose a lot of things that you should be enjoying in your youth such as having friends , enjoying some fun in school and learning more about yourself. It\u2019s really sad that these friend of mine who I spoke to , left due to their own circumstances and none of my classmates remember them like they don\u2019t exist . I personally do not want to barge into your situation unless you are okay with it. Whatever situation you are in, I wish you all the best for your future endeavor and I hope that you could find your own happiness and what suits you best .",
