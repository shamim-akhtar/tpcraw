    "comment": "it's very difficult to pass the trials as someone with no prior experience, to get into the sports ccas is really competitive and majority of students at the trials have prior experience. they shortlist those that can perform well so if you're confident that you can outperform those with prior experience then go for it. this isn't meant to discourage you, you never know the outcome and i still think you should go ahead with the trials but i'm just informing you that your chances of getting in are slim. all the best :)",
