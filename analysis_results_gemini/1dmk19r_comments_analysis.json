    "comment": "If they state that you need to request for it means that you should ask your teacher if you could do the tutorial online. Usually the teacher expects a valid reason to do so. Unless your teacher says otherwise before, i think the above is the case. Diff modules/lectures have diff requirements for hybrid tutorial. I have both modules before where the teacher requires a VR before u go online and teachers that explicitly told us we can go online when we wish to do so w/o requesting.",
