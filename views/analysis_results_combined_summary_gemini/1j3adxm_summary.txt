The Reddit post and comments center on a student's negative experience with a specific subject, CRM (likely referring to Customer Relationship Management), within an Engineering diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The post focuses on the student's poor grade in this subject and implicitly expresses dissatisfaction.  There are no further comments to analyze the sentiment further.

The overall sentiment expressed is negative and frustrated. The student's disappointment with their grade in CRM is clearly evident.  There's a lack of positive feedback regarding the subject, the teaching methods, or the school's facilities.  The focus solely rests on the negative experience with the CRM subject itself.

Given the limited information, the primary concern for senior management is the apparent dissatisfaction with the CRM subject within the Engineering diploma program.  A review of the curriculum, teaching methodologies, and assessment methods for CRM is recommended to identify potential areas for improvement.  Gathering student feedback through surveys or focus groups could shed light on the reasons behind the negative experiences and help in designing more effective learning strategies for this crucial subject.
