The Reddit post and comments center on the application process for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Aviation Management course, specifically the Early Admission Exercise (EAE).  The main discussion revolves around the timing of interview invitations following the aptitude test, with several applicants expressing anxiety about the lack of communication from the school.  Several commenters shared their experiences and offered reassurance, indicating that interview invitations are often sent out later than initially anticipated.

The overall sentiment is one of anxious anticipation and hopeful waiting.  While some applicants express concern about the delayed interview invitations, the majority of comments offer reassurance and support, sharing similar experiences and offering words of encouragement. The comments highlight the lack of communication regarding the interview process for the Aviation Management, and more broadly, several engineering courses at TP.  There is no direct criticism of the school's facilities or specific aspects of the program itself; the focus remains on the application timeline and the uncertainty surrounding it.

Given the concerns raised regarding the delayed communication surrounding interview invitations for the Aviation Management and other engineering courses, I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review their communication protocols for the EAE process.  Proactive communication, such as providing estimated timelines for interview invitations and updates on application progress, would alleviate applicant anxiety and improve the overall applicant experience.  This should be extended to all engineering courses to ensure consistent communication across programs.
