The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the existence and application of a bell curve grading system at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original post is a humorous plea for grade balance, while the comments largely refute the idea of a strict bell curve, suggesting instead that some form of grade moderation or adjustment might occur.  There's disagreement among commenters about the specifics of TP's grading system.

The overall sentiment is a mix of skepticism and mild amusement.  The original post uses playful language, implying a stress-related concern about grades.  The comments display a casual, informal tone, with some users expressing disbelief regarding the existence of a strict bell curve at TP. While no specific subjects, school facilities, or aspects of the school beyond the grading system are mentioned, the discussion directly relates to academic assessment methods and student perception of fairness in grading.

While no serious concerns are raised, it is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management consider clarifying their grading policies publicly.  The ambiguity around grade moderation or adjustment, and the ensuing student discussions and speculation, could create unnecessary anxiety among students. A transparent explanation of the grading system, including how moderation is applied (if at all), would foster greater trust and reduce student stress regarding academic performance.
