The Reddit post and comments center on the necessity of owning a laptop for courses at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster is unsure if a laptop is required while awaiting an appeal for a financial aid program (PFP).  Commenters largely agree that a laptop is practically essential for accessing course materials and completing assignments, though some suggest an iPad might suffice depending on the specific course, and one commenter provides a suggestion to check the TP website for course-specific laptop requirements.


The overall sentiment is a mix of helpfulness and impatience.  While several commenters offer informative and supportive responses regarding the practical need for a laptop and where to find specific information, one commenter displays negativity and frustration towards the original poster's question.  The comments generally indicate that the online learning environment at TP necessitates access to a computing device beyond a smartphone.  No specific facilities or subjects beyond the general reliance on online learning materials are mentioned in the discussion.


The negative comment from "BlacksmithGloomy9448" ("Bro u think leh ? What a stupid question . Can't believe you'd even ask this") highlights a potential concern.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider improving communication regarding technology requirements for students, especially those facing financial challenges and applying for programs like PFP.  A more welcoming and informative approach to frequently asked questions about essential technology could help avoid negative interactions and ensure all students have the necessary information to succeed, regardless of their financial situation.  Furthermore, a clearer and more easily accessible online guide outlining technology requirements by course could preemptively answer similar questions and reduce the workload on student support services.
