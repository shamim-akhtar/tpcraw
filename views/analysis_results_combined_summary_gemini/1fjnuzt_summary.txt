The Reddit post and comments center on the concerns of a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student who received a 2.8 GPA in their first semester (Y1S1).  Many commenters share their own experiences of low GPAs in their first year, emphasizing the possibility of improvement in subsequent semesters.  Discussions also touch upon the relative difficulty of Y1S1 compared to later semesters, the importance of written exams versus project-based assessments, and the feasibility of achieving higher GPAs and gaining admission to universities like NUS and NTU.  Several commenters boast high GPAs, offering encouragement and advice.


The overall sentiment is one of reassurance and support. While initial anxiety and discouragement are evident in the original post, the overwhelming response from other TP students and alumni is positive and encouraging.  The comments express empathy for the struggles of balancing academics and project work, particularly concerning written exams.  There's admiration for those achieving high GPAs, but also a realistic acknowledgement of the challenges faced by many students.  No specific negative comments about TP's facilities or school administration are mentioned.


While no direct criticism of Temasek Polytechnic is present,  senior management might consider investigating students' perceptions of the relative difficulty of Y1S1 compared to later semesters.  The varied experiences reported (some found Y1 the hardest, others found later semesters more challenging) suggest the need to examine the curriculum and teaching methods across different years to ensure a consistent level of support and challenge for all students.  Furthermore, the numerous comments about struggling with written exams hint at the potential for improvement in exam preparation resources or exam format itself.  A review of student support systems and resources, particularly for students struggling with specific subjects or exam styles, would be beneficial.
