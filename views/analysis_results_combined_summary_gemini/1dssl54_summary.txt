The Reddit post and comments center around the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) shortlisting process at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster is anxious about the timeline for receiving an email regarding their application status, given conflicting information about when emails are typically sent.  Comments provide anecdotal evidence of past applicants receiving emails in July, sparking further discussion and anxiety among those awaiting updates.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and impatience.  Students express worry about the lack of consistent information regarding the EAE shortlisting process and are actively seeking reassurance from others who have gone through the process.  The comments reveal a desire for transparency regarding the timeline and a concern that some applicants may be receiving notifications earlier than others. There is no direct criticism of the school's facilities or other aspects beyond the EAE process itself.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  To alleviate student anxiety surrounding the EAE process, consider improving communication regarding the application timeline. Providing a more precise timeframe for email notifications, or even a range of dates instead of vague statements, would reduce uncertainty and stress among applicants.  The inconsistencies in the timing of email notifications reported in the comments suggest a need for review and standardization of the process to ensure fairness and transparency for all applicants.
