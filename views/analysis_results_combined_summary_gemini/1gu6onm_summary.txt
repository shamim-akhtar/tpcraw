The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student struggling with a low GPA and seeking advice on future prospects after graduation.  The main topics discussed include strategies for improving GPA, alternative pathways after polytechnic (e.g., private university, work), the challenging curriculum at Temasek Polytechnic, and the role of extracurricular activities (CCAs) in university admissions.

The overall sentiment is one of concern and support, mixed with frustration towards the perceived difficulties of the Temasek Polytechnic curriculum.  While several commenters offer encouraging words and practical advice,  Ok-Engineering143 directly expresses negative sentiment towards the school's curriculum, citing confusing lecture notes, excessive assessments, and a lack of support from lecturers. The student's own comments reveal feelings of distress and inadequacy.  Mentions of the school itself focus on the challenging academic environment and lack of support in improving grades. No specific facilities are mentioned.


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the recurring criticism of a demanding and confusing curriculum.  Ok-Engineering143's comment highlights a potential systemic issue with lecture notes, tutorial questions, excessive workload, and a lack of adequate lecturer support.  This suggests a need for a review of the curriculum's design, teaching methodologies, and the provision of more robust student support services to address the expressed difficulties students are facing.  The lack of  mention regarding facilities suggests this is not a major concern currently.  Investigating student feedback mechanisms and implementing strategies to improve clarity and support would be beneficial.
