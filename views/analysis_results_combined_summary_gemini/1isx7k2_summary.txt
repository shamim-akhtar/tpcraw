The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the difficulty of the ADEV/BDAV (likely Application Development and Database Administration) test at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students express frustration with the exam's format, particularly the open-ended questions, the lack of a code editor, and the closed-book nature of the assessment.  The difficulty of the material, perceived as heavily reliant on memorization rather than application of knowledge, is a central theme.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration, anger, and disappointment with the exam.  Words like "difficult," "mad," "bs," "cooked," and "unrealistic" reflect a strongly critical tone.  The school's School of IIT (likely Information and Information Technology) is directly criticized for the exam design.  Specific concerns are raised about the open-ended questions requiring specialized knowledge, the lack of a code editor hindering practical application, and the closed-book format deemed unrealistic and promoting rote memorization.  Students express doubt about the availability of sufficient passing grades.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Senior management should review the ADEV/BDAV exam design and format.  The overwhelmingly negative student feedback highlights serious concerns about the exam's fairness and effectiveness in assessing student understanding.  Specifically, the following areas require immediate attention:

* **Open-ended questions:** Re-evaluate the complexity and knowledge required for these questions to ensure they accurately assess practical skills rather than rote memorization.
* **Code editor provision:** Consider allowing a code editor during the exam to better reflect real-world application development scenarios and reduce the emphasis on memorization.
* **Closed-book format:** Explore alternative assessment methods that better reflect the practical skills needed for these subjects, perhaps by incorporating project-based assessments or open-book exams with restricted resources.
* **Examination grading:** Carefully examine the pass/fail rate for the exam.  Addressing the concerns around sufficient passing grades might require adjusting the marking scheme or evaluating the overall difficulty of the assessment.  A post-mortem analysis of the exam should be conducted and student feedback formally collected and considered.
