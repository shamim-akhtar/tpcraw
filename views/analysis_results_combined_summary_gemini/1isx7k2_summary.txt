The Reddit post and comments primarily center on the difficulty of the ADEV/BDAV (likely Application Development and Database Administration) test at Temasek Polytechnic.  Discussions revolve around the test's format (closed book, no code editor), the types of questions (MCQ, closed response, open-ended), and the perceived unfairness of the assessment, particularly regarding its memorization-heavy nature and lack of practical application.  Students express frustration with the difficulty of open-ended questions and the unrealistic nature of a closed-book exam for a coding subject.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by frustration, disappointment, and even anger towards the exam and the School of IIT (Information and IT).  Words like "cooked," "bs," "mad," "unrealistic," and "clowns" reflect this strong negative emotion.  Students express concern about the possibility of insufficient passing grades.  Specific concerns are raised regarding the lack of a code editor, the emphasis on rote memorization rather than practical application, and the difficulty of the open-ended questions, especially those related to database joins and API boilerplates.  The schoolâ€™s facilities are criticized indirectly through the comment highlighting the lack of a code editor during the exam.

**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic's School of IIT should review the ADEV/BDAV assessment process.  The lack of a code editor during the exam is a major concern and should be addressed. The curriculum and exam format should be revised to focus less on rote memorization and more on practical application of coding skills.  The difficulty of the open-ended questions should be reevaluated to ensure a fair assessment of student understanding.  Consider incorporating a more realistic, practical exam setting, perhaps allowing for limited online resources or a more forgiving open-book approach.  Finally, a review of the grading rubric and expectations for passing is warranted given student concerns about insufficient passing grades.
