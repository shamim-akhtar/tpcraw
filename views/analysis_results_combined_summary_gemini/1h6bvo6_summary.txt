The Reddit post and comments center on criticisms of the Information Technology (IT) curriculum at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), specifically the pacing and content of the HTML, CSS, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAG) modules. Students express concerns about the rushed schedule, inadequate coverage of essential CSS concepts like flexbox, and the perceived redundancy of material between semesters.  Many commenters also criticize the TPFun program, suggesting it's a waste of time and advocating for more elective choices.  Inconsistent teaching quality and arbitrary restrictions on using modern tools and libraries (like React and TypeScript) are also highlighted.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration and disappointment with the teaching quality, curriculum pacing, and course structure.  Students feel rushed and unprepared for assignments, particularly regarding the practical application of CSS.  Specific criticisms target the DSAG module's pacing, the lack of in-depth CSS instruction (including flexbox), and the arbitrary restrictions on using modern development tools.  The TPFun program is widely viewed as inefficient use of time.  While some comments acknowledge that understanding fundamentals is important, the prevailing tone suggests that the current approach fails to strike a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application. The overall lack of consistency between lecturers and their approach is also a significant point of contention.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:

1. **Curriculum Review:**  Re-evaluate the pacing and content of the IT curriculum, specifically the HTML/CSS and DSAG modules.  Address the redundancy reported between semesters.  Ensure adequate time is allocated to crucial concepts like flexbox and other modern CSS techniques. Consider incorporating student feedback on the optimal balance between fundamental concepts and practical application using modern tools and libraries.

2. **Teacher Training and Standardization:** Implement standardized teaching practices across different lecturers within the same modules to ensure consistency in teaching quality and approach. Provide additional training for lecturers to enhance their teaching effectiveness and address the reported inconsistencies.

3. **TPFun Redesign:**  Re-evaluate the effectiveness of the TPFun program and consider options to improve its engagement value or replace it with more relevant and student-choice-oriented electives, as suggested by many students.

4. **Modern Tool Usage:** Review and adjust the restrictions on using modern web development tools and libraries in IT modules.  A more flexible approach which allows for suitable tools while retaining emphasis on foundational understanding could be considered. The arbitrary nature of these restrictions based on individual lecturers needs to be addressed.
