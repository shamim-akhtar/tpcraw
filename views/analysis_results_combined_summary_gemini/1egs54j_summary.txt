The Reddit post and comment discuss the impact of absences on scholarship applications at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original post asks whether a single absence, within the allowed two absences, will negatively affect scholarship opportunities. The comment assures the poster that a single absence within the allowed limit shouldn't be a problem.

The overall sentiment is reassuring and slightly informal.  The commenter uses colloquial language ("should be okay ah ðŸ’¯") suggesting a relaxed and helpful tone.  There's no explicit mention of specific school facilities or subjects, and the discussion is narrowly focused on the attendance policy and its potential repercussions regarding scholarships.

While the issue raised is minor, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider reviewing the clarity of their attendance policy regarding scholarship applications.  A concise, readily accessible explanation on the school website or student handbook explicitly stating the impact (or lack thereof) of absences within the permitted allowance on scholarship eligibility would alleviate student anxiety and prevent similar inquiries.
