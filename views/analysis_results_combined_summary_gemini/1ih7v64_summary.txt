The Reddit post and comments center on a newly accepted Temasek Polytechnic (TP) psychology student seeking advice and support from current and former students.  The main topics discussed include the anticipated workload and schedule of the psychology program,  requests for advice on preparing for the course, and the formation of a peer support network among incoming students.  Several senior students offered assistance and mentorship.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic.  The new student expresses excitement and apprehension about starting the program.  The responses from current and former students are largely supportive and welcoming, creating a friendly and helpful online community.  There is a focus on connecting with fellow students and obtaining practical advice regarding the psychology program at TP.  No specific negative comments were made regarding the school, its facilities, or the psychology program itself, aside from a brief moment of apprehension from the new student regarding the need for video calls with an alumni.

While no specific concerns arise regarding the school's facilities or management, a recommendation could be made to provide more easily accessible and organized resources for incoming students. A dedicated online forum or mentorship program could further facilitate the connections already organically forming in this Reddit thread, offering official support and guidance to ease the transition into the TP psychology program.  This proactive approach could address potential anxieties of new students, like the one experienced in this thread regarding identity verification during a virtual meeting with an alum.
