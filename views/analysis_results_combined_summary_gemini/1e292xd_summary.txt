The Reddit post and comments center on the interview process for Temasek Polytechnic's Law and Management (T09) course.  The original poster seeks advice on potential interview questions, while commenters share their experiences, offering suggestions and warnings about what to avoid saying (e.g., stating a desire to become a lawyer directly).  Some commenters offer to provide more information privately.

The overall sentiment is a mix of anxiety and helpfulness.  The original poster expresses nervousness and a desire for assistance.  Commenters offer support and advice, mainly cautioning against clich√© answers like wanting to be a lawyer because of pop culture influences.  The mention of Temasek Polytechnic is positive,  but there is no specific discussion of school facilities or other aspects beyond the interview process for the Law and Management course. The emotional tone ranges from anxious (OP and some commenters) to supportive and slightly humorous (commenters offering advice).

While no specific concerns about the school or its facilities are raised, a recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic's admissions department would be to provide more transparent and readily available information about the interview process for prospective students.  This could include sample interview questions or a more detailed description of the selection criteria on their website, potentially alleviating some of the anxiety expressed by applicants.  This would also benefit applicants aiming for other courses at the polytechnic, not just the Law and Management course.
