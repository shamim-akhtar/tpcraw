The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic AEG/AEL Global Studies overseas trip to Shenzhen, China.  The original poster desperately wanted the Shenzhen trip, offering money to others to relinquish their spot due to their affinity for China and Chinese culture.  Several comments revealed that the Shenzhen trip was cancelled and students were reassigned to Guangzhou, with additional slots opened. The poster's initial disappointment eventually turned to joy upon securing a spot on a trip, though the final destination remains unclear.

The overall sentiment is initially one of desperation and humor, stemming from the original poster's strong desire for the Shenzhen trip.  Comments range from dismissive of the monetary offer to informative about the cancellation and reassignments. The final sentiment is one of relief and happiness as the poster secures a spot on a trip, though not necessarily Shenzhen.  There is no direct negative feedback regarding Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or school administration, but the cancellation and reassignment of the Shenzhen trip indirectly raises questions about the program's logistical planning.

While there are no direct criticisms of Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or teaching staff, the cancellation of the Shenzhen trip and subsequent reassignment to Guangzhou suggests a need for improved communication and contingency planning for overseas study programs. Senior management should review the processes surrounding the cancellation, ensuring clearer communication to students throughout the process, and developing more robust contingency plans for future overseas trips to mitigate similar disruptions.  This includes investigating the reasons for the cancellation to prevent recurrence.
