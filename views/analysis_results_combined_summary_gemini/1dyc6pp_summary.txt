The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Year 1 student's intention to drop out of their Communication Design Program (CDP) course.  The main discussion points revolve around the financial implications of dropping out, including unknown fees beyond tuition, and the student's future prospects if they leave TP without completing their diploma.  Commenters offer advice ranging from exploring financial aid options to considering alternative paths like ITE's work-study program or reapplying through JAE (Joint Admission Exercise).

The overall sentiment is a mix of concern and caution.  While some commenters express empathy for the student's situation, the prevailing tone is one of strong discouragement towards dropping out.  Several commenters emphasize the potential negative consequences on future career prospects and the importance of persevering to complete the diploma.  The school itself is not directly criticized, but the comments highlight the potential hardships faced by students who leave before graduation.  The facilities or specific aspects of the school are not mentioned in the discussion.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  The discussion highlights a potential gap in student support.  While the student received information on tuition fees, the lack of clarity regarding other potential withdrawal fees is a concern.  Senior management should review the information provided to students considering withdrawal, ensuring a clear and easily accessible breakdown of all associated costs.  Furthermore, proactive outreach programs offering support and guidance to struggling students, addressing financial concerns and career prospects, could help prevent students from making potentially detrimental decisions like dropping out. This could include improved communication regarding financial aid options and connecting students with relevant resources.
