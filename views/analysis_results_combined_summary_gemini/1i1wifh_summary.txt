The Reddit post and comments express widespread dissatisfaction with the School of Informatics & IT (IIT) at Temasek Polytechnic.  Key issues include poorly planned course schedules (NECT quiz details released one week before the exam), inadequate assessment feedback (lack of explanations for grades on projects and mock quizzes lacking detail), inconsistent support (some classes receiving ADEV consultations while others do not), reliance on outdated teaching methods and materials (heavy use of YouTube videos and outdated technologies), and a perceived lack of coordination and central planning within the school. Students report feeling unprepared for industry standards and overwhelmed by the fast pace and lack of support.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration, anger, disappointment, and a sense of being undervalued as students.  Many comments describe feeling overwhelmed, unprepared, and unfairly treated.  The school's teaching methods, particularly the reliance on YouTube videos and outdated technologies, are heavily criticized. The lack of feedback on projects and the inconsistent application of support across different classes are also sources of significant frustration.  Specific mentions include the NECT exam, ADEV consultations, and various modules like COMT and DSAG.  The physical condition of the IIT building is also negatively commented upon, in comparison to other schools at Temasek Polytechnic.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the serious concerns raised regarding the School of Informatics & IT (IIT).  Immediate actions should include reviewing course planning and scheduling processes to ensure timely release of information and adequate preparation time for students.  A complete overhaul of the assessment and feedback system is crucial, including providing detailed feedback on all projects and improving the functionality of mock quizzes.  The over-reliance on YouTube videos and outdated technologies needs to be addressed, potentially through investment in updated equipment and a review of teaching methods to incorporate more hands-on instruction and personalized support.  Furthermore, an investigation into the inconsistencies in ADEV consultations and project instructions is necessary to ensure fair treatment of all students. Finally, a review of the internship placement process and resources within IIT is needed. The school should consider investing in facilities upgrades for IIT to match other schools within Temasek Polytechnic.  Addressing these issues will improve student satisfaction, prepare students for industry standards, and ultimately enhance the reputation of the IIT school.
