The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's desire to change their field of study from Early Childhood Development and Education (ECDE) to Law or Psychology after graduation.  The student expresses significant dissatisfaction with their current course and seeks advice on transitioning to a different field, possibly through university admission.  A commenter shares a similar experience and provides links to relevant university course information for prospective TP graduates.


The overall sentiment is one of frustration and uncertainty. The original poster expresses strong dissatisfaction with their ECDE program at TP, highlighting a lack of initial career direction.  The tone is anxious and seeking solutions. While no direct criticism is leveled at the school's facilities or specific aspects of the ECDE program, the underlying feeling is one of regret and a desire for an alternative path, implying a perceived lack of flexibility within TP's curriculum regarding field changes.  The provided links point to external university options, not directly related to TPâ€™s internal processes.


There are no specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management based on this limited interaction. However, the post indirectly suggests a potential area for improvement: exploring options for students who wish to change their field of study within the Polytechnic or offering more comprehensive career guidance earlier in their academic journey.  The strong dissatisfaction expressed by the student with their chosen major, despite approaching graduation, highlights a potential need for improved career counseling and academic planning support within TP.
