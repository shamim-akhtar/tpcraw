The Reddit post and comments center on the delayed enrolment email for Temasek Polytechnic (TP) students admitted via the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE).  Students are expressing anxiety about the late arrival of their emails, particularly concerning the approaching deadline (February 27th) to submit enrolment documents.  The need to undergo a colour vision test, adding to the time pressure, is also a major concern, along with questions about where to get this test done (polyclinic vs. private clinic).  Many students who entered through the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) received their emails much earlier, fueling frustration among JAE applicants.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and frustration.  Students express worry about missing the deadline and the added complication of the colour vision test.  There is a mix of reassurance from those who have received their emails or believe the delay is normal, but the prevailing tone is one of impatience and stress. The delayed email is the central subject of concern, impacting students' ability to meet enrolment deadlines.  Discussions regarding the colour vision test highlight concerns about access to testing facilities and the perceived rush imposed by the late email delivery. There's also a positive aspect shown by helpful students sharing their experiences and advice on the color vision test procedure and document submission.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

1. **Review Enrolment Email Distribution Process:** Investigate the significant delay in sending enrolment emails to JAE applicants compared to EAE applicants.  Analyze the process to identify bottlenecks and implement improvements to ensure timely delivery for all applicants, avoiding future anxieties and last-minute rushes.

2. **Clarify Colour Vision Test Procedures:** Provide clearer and more accessible information regarding colour vision tests.  The conflicting information (polyclinic vs. private clinic) needs resolution.  If private clinics are necessary, a list of recommended clinics should be readily available to students.  The information should be prominently displayed on the TP website and within the enrolment package.

3. **Improve Communication and Support:**  Proactively communicate with students about potential delays.  Provide regular updates and establish a dedicated support channel (e.g., a frequently asked questions page or a help desk) to address anxieties and queries effectively and promptly.  This will alleviate student stress and improve their overall enrolment experience.
