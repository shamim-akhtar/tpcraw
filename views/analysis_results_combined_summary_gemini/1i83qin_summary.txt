The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's distress with their Information and Interactive Technology (IIT) course.  The student expresses extreme frustration, feelings of inadequacy, and a desire to drop out to pursue design.  Several commenters offer advice ranging from seeking counseling and medication to considering a diploma change or taking a gap year.  Underlying discussions touch upon the challenges of the IIT curriculum, the emotional toll of academic pressure, and the process of choosing a suitable career path.

The overall sentiment is one of empathy and concern for the student's emotional well-being. While the initial post expresses intense negativity and despair towards the IIT course, the comments predominantly offer supportive and encouraging advice. The IIT course is implicitly criticized for its perceived difficulty, leading to significant student stress. There's no direct mention of specific facilities, but the comments indirectly highlight the need for improved student support systems, including readily available counselling services.

I recommend Temasek Polytechnic senior management review the IIT curriculum to assess if its difficulty is disproportionate to the student support systems available.  Increased access to mental health resources and career counseling should be a priority.  The high number of students expressing similar sentiments (as shown by the comments) suggests a need for proactive interventions to prevent similar situations in the future.  Investigating the potential reasons behind student dissatisfaction with the IIT curriculum could inform improvements and provide early intervention strategies to assist students who may be struggling.
