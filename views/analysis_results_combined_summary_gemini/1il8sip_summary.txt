The Reddit post and comments primarily focus on the Information Technology in Logistics (ITL) course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster seeks information about the course's workload, stress level, typical timetable, and general polytechnic experience.  Commenters, including a Year 1 and a Year 3 student, provide insights into the course curriculum, workload distribution across years, typical class hours, and the importance of teamwork and self-initiative for academic success.  One commenter also offers advice on finding good project partners.


The overall sentiment is positive and helpful.  Commenters describe the ITL course as "not stressful" and "pretty manageable" with a manageable timetable featuring shorter school days, particularly compared to other courses.  The Year 1 student highlights the flexibility of the timetable with later start times.  While the Year 2 workload is mentioned as being heavier, the general tone remains optimistic and encouraging, emphasizing the importance of proactive learning and collaboration. There is no negative sentiment expressed towards the school, its facilities, or specific instructors.


No specific concerns are raised regarding the school or its facilities. However, for senior management, it might be beneficial to review the curriculum design to ensure a consistent and manageable workload distribution across all years, specifically addressing the perceived increase in workload in Year 2.  Further investigation into the effectiveness of group projects and support systems available to students navigating these projects would be beneficial,  considering the suggestions by the Year 1 student about the importance of independent work and proactive teacher consultations to achieve high marks.
