The Reddit post and comments center on students' experiences with a quiz in a course called "NuH" (likely an abbreviation for a specific subject at Temasek Polytechnic).  The main discussion revolves around the difficulty of the quiz, with students expressing feelings of being unprepared and making mistakes, specifically mentioning incorrect answers and insufficient memorization of key information.  The focus is primarily on student anxieties and concerns regarding their performance.


The overall sentiment is one of anxiety, frustration, and disappointment.  The repeated use of "cooked" indicates a high level of stress and perceived failure.  Students express concern about their grade ("healthy plate," likely referring to a grading rubric) and openly admit to inadequate preparation, focusing only on highlighted information.  There is no positive sentiment expressed towards the quiz itself or any aspects of the school or its facilities.  The comments are focused solely on the students' negative experience with the NuH quiz.


Given the expressed student anxiety and the indication of inadequate preparation stemming from focusing solely on highlighted material, it is recommended that the relevant Temasek Polytechnic faculty teaching "NuH" review their teaching methods.  Specifically, an assessment of the quiz design and its alignment with course material is warranted.  Exploration of alternative study strategies beyond simple memorization of highlighted material, such as encouraging deeper understanding of concepts, would be beneficial.  Furthermore, it may be helpful to assess student feedback regarding the quiz's difficulty to ascertain if the material was appropriately presented throughout the course.
