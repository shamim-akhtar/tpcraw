The Reddit post and comments center on the significant GPA drops experienced by second-year Early Childhood students at Temasek Polytechnic in a particular semester.  The original poster expresses concern about their own drastic GPA decline and seeks validation from others who may have had similar experiences.  The lack of comments suggests limited engagement or response to the initial post.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and disappointment. The author expresses clear distress over their significant GPA drop from 3.5 to 2.7. The lack of comments could indicate either that few students experienced similar issues, or that students are hesitant to publicly share their academic struggles.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities or subjects, only the implication that the curriculum or assessment methods within the Early Childhood program might be contributing factors to the reported GPA decline.

Given the single post expressing significant academic distress among Early Childhood Year 2 students, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the potential causes behind the reported GPA drops.  A review of the curriculum, assessment methods, and teaching strategies within the Early Childhood program is recommended.  Anonymous surveys could be distributed to gather further data on student experiences and identify any systemic issues affecting student performance.  Providing additional academic support services, such as tutoring or counseling, could also prove beneficial for students facing academic challenges.
