The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the experiences of students in the Business School (BUS) at Temasek Polytechnic, specifically the Certificate in Business Practice (CBP) course.  Key topics include the collaborative learning environment (characterized by varying levels of student engagement and competitiveness), the relatively light academic workload, the quality of the canteen and on-campus food options, and the importance of choosing groupmates strategically for successful project completion.

The overall sentiment is largely negative, with a prevailing sense of cynicism and frustration regarding the social dynamics within the Business School.  Comments describe the student body as "snakey," highlighting a lack of collaborative spirit and a prevalence of students prioritizing individual performance over teamwork.  The canteen receives particularly harsh criticism, described as "worst" and "shitty," leading students to seek lunch options elsewhere. The First Avenue convenience store is mentioned as an alternative, albeit an expensive one.  Conversely, the relatively lighter academic workload (compared to other schools) is viewed positively, albeit with a warning to use the free time wisely.  Concerns about navigating interpersonal relationships within group projects and the importance of choosing reliable groupmates are also emphasized.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include addressing the negative social dynamics within the Business School.  Specifically, initiatives promoting collaborative learning and teamwork should be explored.  Additionally, improvements to the quality and selection of food options in the canteen are warranted, considering the considerable dissatisfaction expressed by students. Finally, the management should consider the impact of a potentially competitive learning environment and the resultant stress on student wellbeing.
