The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's struggles with a Year 1, Semester 2 (Y1S2) assignment in the Application Development (ADEV) module, specifically involving linking vending machine locations and items in a database. The student expresses significant frustration with the lack of clear instructions and available resources, seeking help with implementing the database join and displaying the data dynamically on a website built using VS Code.  Comments offer suggestions using SQL joins, IDs, and joint tables, but the student remains confused about the implementation within their VS Code project.

The overall sentiment is one of intense stress and frustration. The student expresses feelings of being overwhelmed, confused, and even suicidal ("should I just Jump⁉️⁉️⁉️").  Other students express similar feelings ("IM SO COOKED"). The focus of negative emotion is directed primarily at the assignment's complexity and the perceived lack of sufficient guidance from the lecturer and available learning resources. The specific subject of ADEV, the assignment itself (linking vending machine data), the usage of VS Code, and the lack of clarity in the module's instructions are all sources of reported difficulty.  There's a notable absence of positive sentiment regarding the school, facilities, or learning experience.

**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

The student's distress highlights a critical need for improved learning support within the ADEV module.  Specifically,  the curriculum should provide clearer instructions and more comprehensive examples for complex assignments, particularly those involving database interactions and web development using VS Code.  Consider supplementing lectures with interactive tutorials, workshops, or additional online resources.  Increased availability of teaching assistants or readily accessible online support forums could greatly reduce student anxiety and improve the learning experience. The concerning suicidal ideation expressed in the post necessitates immediate action to improve mental health support services for students experiencing academic stress.  A review of the ADEV curriculum and assessment strategies is warranted to ensure assignments are appropriately challenging and adequately supported with clear guidance and resources.
