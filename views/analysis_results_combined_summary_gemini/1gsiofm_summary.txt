The Reddit post and its comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic Biomedical Engineering (BME) diploma graduate's question about university course options after graduation.  The main discussion revolves around the possibility of pursuing university degrees in fields other than biomedical engineering, specifically mentioning engineering-related courses and business as potential alternatives.  The commenter offers advice to check university course prerequisites for specific admission requirements.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful. The original poster expresses confusion and seeks guidance, while the commenter provides a constructive and straightforward answer.  There is no overt negativity or criticism directed towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, its BME diploma program, or its facilities. The focus remains solely on the academic pathways available to the graduate after completing the diploma.

No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted based on this limited discussion. The post and comments do not reveal any issues with the BME program, its curriculum, or the school's facilities.  The query is purely about post-diploma university options.
