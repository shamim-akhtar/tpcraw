The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss a student's inability to submit a course evaluation survey after the deadline. The student contacted the IT department, who stated they couldn't assist.  The main issue revolves around the lack of options for resubmitting the survey after the deadline, and the subsequent resolution provided by another commenter.

The overall sentiment is one of mild concern and then relief. The initial post expresses anxiety about the missed deadline and uncertainty about the consequences.  The response from Altruistic_Hand3617 offers a reassuring solution, suggesting no further action is needed beyond the slight grade release delay.  There is no direct mention of specific subjects, school facilities, or other aspects of Temasek Polytechnic beyond the IT department's involvement (in their inability to assist with late survey submission).

Based on this limited interaction, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management. The issue appears to be an individual student's problem resolved through peer-to-peer advice and not indicative of a systemic issue within the institution's survey system or IT support.  However,  it might be beneficial to explore options for handling late submissions of course evaluations on a case-by-case basis, potentially providing more clarity to students about the procedures and consequences. This could prevent future anxieties among students.
