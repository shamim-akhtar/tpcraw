The Reddit post and its comments center on the continued need for a toolkit and portable digital trainer by Biomedical Engineering (BME) students in their second year at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster, a first-year student transitioning to their second year, inquires about the necessity of these tools, citing the high initial cost and limited use in the first year.  Comments confirm the toolkit's continued use in second-year modules, while suggesting the digital trainer may also be required in the third year.

The overall sentiment is one of mild anxiety and uncertainty regarding the financial burden of maintaining unused equipment.  The author expresses frustration about the seemingly unnecessary expense of tools used only for a limited time.  The comments offer helpful information and reassurance, creating a supportive and collaborative tone. The discussion focuses specifically on the BME program's equipment requirements, particularly the toolkit and portable digital trainer. No other school facilities or subjects beyond BME are mentioned.

While not a major issue, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider reviewing the curriculum and associated equipment requirements for the BME program.  The student's concern about the cost-effectiveness of purchasing tools used only for one year (or potentially two) for certain modules within the BME program, specifically the toolkit and digital trainer, could be addressed.  Investigating alternatives such as renting equipment or providing access to shared resources in designated labs could alleviate financial strain on students while maintaining the necessary practical training components.
