The Reddit post and comments center on the choice of device (iPad vs. laptop) for a business student at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The discussion highlights the challenges of using Microsoft 365 on iOS devices, particularly during Business Technology Applications (BTA) lessons, where tutorials and demonstrations predominantly utilize Windows.  One commenter suggests a dual-device approach (iPad for note-taking, laptop for assignments) as a more efficient solution.  Another commenter mentions a school-prescribed list of devices, recommending students adhere to it. A final comment touches upon the general specifications of the recommended devices, deeming them sufficient for business students but potentially lacking for STEM majors or gamers.


The overall sentiment is helpful and informative, with a predominantly positive tone.  While there's a warning about the limitations of iOS devices within the context of TP's business curriculum and its reliance on Microsoft 365, the comments are ultimately supportive and offer practical advice.  The mention of TP's prescribed device list shows institutional support, while the concern about device specifications hints at a potential need for more powerful options for certain student groups.  There is a sense of welcoming the new student into the TP community.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider reviewing the compatibility of its recommended devices and curriculum.  Specifically, the significant difficulties encountered by students using iOS devices with Microsoft 365 during BTA lessons warrant attention.  Investigating alternative solutions, such as providing more comprehensive iOS-compatible tutorials or adapting BTA demonstrations to be compatible with both Windows and iOS, is recommended.  Furthermore, exploring the specifications of the prescribed devices and ensuring they adequately meet the needs of all students, including those in STEM fields, should be a priority.  This may involve offering a wider range of devices or clarifying the suitability of each device for different course types.
