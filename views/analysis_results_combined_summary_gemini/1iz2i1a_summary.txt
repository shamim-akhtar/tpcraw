The Reddit post and comments center on the choice of device—iPad vs. laptop—for a business student at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The discussion highlights the challenges of using Microsoft 365 on iOS devices, particularly during Business Technology Applications (BTA) lessons, and suggests that a dual-device approach (iPad for note-taking and a Windows laptop for assignments) might be optimal. One commenter mentions a prescribed list of devices provided by TP, course-specific in nature. Another commenter voices a general concern about the specifications of TP's recommended devices.


The overall sentiment is helpful and informative, with a predominantly practical tone.  While welcoming the new student to TP ("Welcome to TP family"), the comments express concern regarding the compatibility of iOS devices with the school's curriculum, particularly the limitations of Microsoft 365 on iOS during BTA modules.  There is a subtle underlying frustration regarding the limitations of the prescribed devices' specifications as mentioned by Ok-Engineering143, but it remains constructive rather than overtly negative.  No specific facilities are mentioned, but the comments highlight the importance of software compatibility and the impact it has on the learning experience within the BTA context.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Review the prescribed device list for business students, paying particular attention to the compatibility of the recommended devices with Microsoft 365.  The comments highlight significant difficulties for students using iOS devices within the BTA module.  Consider providing clearer guidance and support for students choosing their devices, addressing the discrepancies in software functionality across different operating systems.  Further investigation into the specifications voiced concern by "Ok-Engineering143" is recommended to ensure the adequacy of provided devices meets the needs of students across various majors.  Additional support for students requiring a dual-device setup could also alleviate some of the difficulties highlighted in the comments.
