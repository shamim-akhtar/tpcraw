The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's concern about their low Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.72 in their first semester.  Many comments express similar struggles, particularly from students in the Information Technology (IIT) program, reporting GPAs ranging from 2.22 to 2.88.  The discussion also touches upon strategies for GPA improvement, including focusing on classwork, seeking help from lecturers, and the potential impact of internships and Final Year Projects (FYP) on the overall GPA in subsequent semesters.  There's also a brief discussion about the total number of Credit Units (CU) in year 2, with clarification given regarding the added CU from FYP and internship.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and concern, with a significant amount of self-deprecating humor ("cooked").  While there is supportive advice offered, the prevailing emotional tone among the IIT students is one of shared stress and worry about academic performance. The school itself isn't directly criticized; however, the implicit concern is around the difficulty of the IIT program and the pressure to maintain a high GPA.  No specific facilities are mentioned in a negative light.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:

Given the high number of IIT students expressing similar academic struggles and low GPAs, a review of the IIT curriculum and its delivery is warranted.  Exploring potential areas for improvement in teaching methodologies, support systems (such as academic advising or tutoring), and the overall course load could be beneficial.  Additionally, clarifying and disseminating information regarding the weighting and impact of internships and FYPs on the final GPA could help reduce student anxiety.  This could involve creating more easily accessible and clear documentation about the curriculum structure, including CU breakdown per semester and year.
