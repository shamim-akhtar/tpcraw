The Reddit post and comments center on the concerning behavior of a group of male students from Temasek Polytechnic's Global Studies program who are planning a trip to Vientiane, Laos.  The main issue revolves around allegations of sexual harassment, specifically one student repeatedly asking female classmates for "friends with benefits" relationships.  Several commenters express concern about the students' behavior and urge female classmates to report the harassment.

The overall sentiment is one of alarm and disgust towards the alleged perpetrators' actions.  Commenters express anger, concern for the safety of female students, and a desire to see the inappropriate behavior addressed.  There's a strong sense of moral outrage and a call to action to report the harassment. The school itself is not directly criticized, though the incident reflects negatively on the student body and potentially the school's handling of such issues.  No specific facilities or aspects of the school's infrastructure are mentioned.

I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic senior management investigate the allegations of sexual harassment thoroughly.  A formal investigation should be launched to determine the validity of the claims made against the students.  If the allegations are substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken, which may include suspension or expulsion.  Furthermore, the institution should review its existing policies on sexual harassment and ensure that they are clear, accessible, and effectively enforced.  Training for staff and students on recognizing and reporting sexual harassment should also be considered, as well as offering support services for those who have experienced harassment.  The focus should be on creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students.
