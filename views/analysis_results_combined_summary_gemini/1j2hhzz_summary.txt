The main issue highlighted is the alleged sexually harassing behavior of these students, specifically one described as "tall and egoistic," who has repeatedly propositioned female classmates for "friends with benefits" relationships.  The comments express concern about this behavior and urge female students to report the incidents to the appropriate authorities.

The overall sentiment is one of alarm and anger towards the reported behavior of the male students.  There's a strong sense of disapproval and disgust towards their actions, with comments advocating for reporting the harassment.  The emotional tone is a mix of outrage, concern for the female students' safety, and a desire to see justice served.  No specific mention is made of the school's facilities or other aspects of the school beyond the Global Studies program and the impending trip.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Given the serious allegations of sexual harassment, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should immediately investigate the reported behavior of the male students involved in the Global Studies program.  A formal investigation should be launched, including interviews with the affected female students and the accused male students.  Clear policies on sexual harassment and reporting procedures should be reiterated to all students, and the school should offer support services to any students who have experienced harassment.  Further, preventative measures should be considered to address potential future instances of similar behavior, such as mandatory workshops on consent and respectful relationships for all students.
