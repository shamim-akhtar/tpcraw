The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences within the School of Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The primary discussion revolves around the overall culture and learning environment within the engineering school, specifically focusing on the intensity of the courses, the competitiveness among students, and the willingness of students to help each other.  One commenter strongly advises against attending the School of Engineering at TP.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While some comments highlight the supportive and collaborative nature of the student body, emphasizing a willingness to help each other learn, other comments express a significantly negative outlook.  The word "horrific" is used to describe the experience, and the necessity of "stamina & strong mentality" is stressed, suggesting a highly demanding and competitive academic environment.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities but the implied high pressure suggests potential impacts on student well-being which may be linked to teaching methodologies or workload.  The negative comment advising against joining the School of Engineering highlights a serious concern about the overall student experience.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic's School of Engineering should investigate the strongly negative comments regarding the demanding nature of the courses and the overall student experience.  The use of the word "horrific" and the emphasis on the need for exceptional mental stamina suggest a need to review the curriculum's intensity and workload.  Further investigation into student well-being and support systems is warranted to address the potential for negative impacts on students' mental health within this highly competitive environment.  A balanced approach to fostering both academic excellence and student well-being should be prioritized.
