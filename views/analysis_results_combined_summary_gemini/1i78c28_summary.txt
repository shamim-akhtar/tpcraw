The Reddit post and comments center on the anxieties of a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Computer Engineering student regarding potential homophobia among his peers.  The original poster (OP) expresses concern about being judged based on his sexual orientation, particularly within the engineering environment.  Comments offer a range of perspectives, some suggesting that while outright homophobia might be uncommon, insensitive or gossiping behavior could still occur, while others emphasize that most students would likely be unconcerned.

The overall sentiment is a mixture of apprehension and reassurance. The OP expresses significant nervousness and insecurity about potential negative reactions, while many commenters attempt to alleviate these fears, suggesting that while some intolerant individuals may exist, the majority of students are likely to be accepting or indifferent.  There is a notable lack of discussion about the school's facilities or its overall environment beyond the specific concerns about social acceptance within the engineering department.  A negative undertone arises from a dismissive and arguably homophobic comment, and the subsequent exchange between the OP and that commenter.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the potential for a less-than-welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students, particularly within the engineering department. While the comments suggest that outright bullying might be rare, the recurring themes of concern over gossip, judgment, and the need to "act straight" indicate a need to explore whether the school's culture fosters inclusivity.  The incident involving the dismissive and homophobic comment highlights a potential need for improved education and support for students to prevent homophobic behavior and create a safer, more supportive environment for all.  A review of existing anti-discrimination policies and their enforcement, alongside possible training initiatives for students and staff, would be beneficial.
