The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's inquiry about changing courses after completing the Pre-Foundation Programme (PFP).  The student, accepted into Aerospace Electronics (T50), wishes to switch to Aviation Management (T04) which they missed the entry requirements for. The comments offer contrasting advice; one definitively states course changes are impossible after PFP completion, while the other suggests consulting a school counselor.


The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty from the original poster regarding their course selection. The comments display a mixture of helpfulness and definitive negativity.  Specific mention is made of the Aerospace Electronics (T50) and Aviation Management (T04) courses, highlighting the student's dissatisfaction with their assigned course and the desire for a course change. No direct mention is made of school facilities.


Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The conflicting advice received by the student highlights a potential gap in communication regarding course changes after PFP. Senior management should review the clarity and accessibility of information regarding course switching policies.  This could involve improving online resources, providing clearer guidelines to PFP students, and ensuring that school counselors are consistently providing accurate and up-to-date information.  Increased transparency about course switching policies will reduce student anxiety and improve the overall student experience.
