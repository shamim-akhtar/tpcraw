The Reddit post and comments center on the frustration experienced by a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student regarding the poorly worded and structured assignment for their IIT (presumably,  Information Technology) DSAG (likely a course code) module. The main issue is the placement of the crucial sample output at the end of the assignment, causing confusion and difficulty for students in understanding the requirements.  The comments largely echo this sentiment, expressing shared frustration and confusion.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by frustration, confusion, and exasperation towards the assignment's design and structure.  Terms like "bloody," "poorly phrased," and "peak IIT experience" reflect this negative emotional tone.  The comments mostly express shared bewilderment and uncertainty about following the sample output, indicating a widespread problem with the assignment's clarity. No specific school facilities are mentioned, but the discussion directly impacts the quality of the IIT DSAG course materials and the learning experience.

I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management in the School of Information Technology review the IIT DSAG module's assignments.  Specifically, the placement and presentation of sample outputs should be revised.  Assignments should be clearly structured, with essential information such as sample outputs placed prominently at the beginning or within the clear instructions, rather than at the end.  Improving the clarity and structure of assignment instructions would significantly enhance student understanding and reduce the frustration evident in the student comments.  A review of the course feedback mechanisms could also identify similar issues before they become widespread.
