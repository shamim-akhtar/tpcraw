The Reddit post and comments center on a poorly worded Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAG) assignment in the Temasek Polytechnic's Institute of Infocomm Technology (IIT).  The main issue is the placement of the sample output at the bottom of the assignment, causing confusion and frustration among students.  Several comments express shared exasperation and humor regarding this experience, with some questioning the necessity of strictly adhering to the sample output's structure.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by frustration, confusion, and a touch of dark humor ("peak IIT experience").  Students express annoyance at the poor phrasing and placement of key information within the assignment.  The comments reveal a general feeling of being overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed with the assignment, specifically referencing the sample output and its unexpected location.  There's no direct criticism of the school's facilities, but the negative experience is directly tied to the quality of the IIT DSAG assignment.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic's IIT should review the design and quality assurance process for course assignments.  Specifically, the placement of crucial information, such as the sample output, should be revised to improve clarity and reduce student frustration.  The poor phrasing of the assignment questions also warrants attention, suggesting a need for better instructional design and faculty training in clear and effective communication within assignment instructions.  This will help improve the overall student experience and reduce unnecessary confusion.
