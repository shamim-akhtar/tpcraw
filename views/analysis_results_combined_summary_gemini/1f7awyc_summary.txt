The overall sentiment of the post is positive and professional. The author presents themselves as highly competent and confident in their ability to deliver effective tutoring.  The focus is on the quality of their teaching and the positive outcomes for students.  The mention of Temasek Polytechnic and the AEL school is presented as a credential to build trust and credibility. No specific facilities or aspects of the school are mentioned beyond the mention of the AEL school.

However, if such services were to become common or advertised extensively on the platform by students, monitoring the quality of these services and their adherence to academic integrity policies might be considered.
