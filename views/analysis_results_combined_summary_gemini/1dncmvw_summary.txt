The student expresses anxiety about the interview and questionnaire process, highlighting the competitive nature of the program and their less-than-ideal academic results.  A previous EAE applicant offers assistance and guidance via Telegram.  Subsequent comments focus on confirming the correct Telegram contact information.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and desperation from the applicant regarding their chances of acceptance into the Veterinary Technology program.  The applicant expresses concern about their academic performance and seeks reassurance and advice. The response from the previous applicant is helpful and supportive, demonstrating a positive community aspect within the Temasek Polytechnic student body.  No specific comments regarding the school's facilities or other aspects beyond the EAE application process are mentioned.

There are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management based on this limited interaction. The discussion solely focuses on the individual student's experience with the EAE application process, and does not reflect broader issues within the Veterinary Technology program or the institution itself.
