The Reddit post and comments center on the curriculum of the Year 1 Common ICT course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster seeks information about the course content, prompting a detailed response outlining topics such as networking fundamentals, UI design, Python programming, data structures, algorithms, web development (HTML, CSS, JS, SQL), and data analytics.  A significant concern is raised regarding the lack of introductory computer skills training, specifically the absence of basic Windows usage instruction.

The overall sentiment is a mix of helpfulness and concern.  While the commenter provides a comprehensive overview of the curriculum and a useful resource (the TP ITSIG website), there's a notable undercurrent of anxiety about the lack of foundational computer skills training. The commenter expresses frustration and uncertainty about whether this deficiency will be addressed by the school.  This is further emphasized by the explicit mention of providing feedback to the school with no guarantee of action. The lack of basic computer skills training is specifically highlighted as a potential problem for students lacking prior experience.  No explicit opinions about the school's facilities are given.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the concern regarding the absence of introductory computer skills training in the Year 1 Common ICT curriculum.  The commenter's observation that students enrolling without prior computing experience are left unprepared suggests a significant gap in the program's design.  Reviewing and potentially revising the curriculum to include a module covering fundamental Windows usage and basic computer literacy is recommended to ensure all students have a solid foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the course.  This would improve student preparedness and reduce the anxiety and potential struggle experienced by students lacking prior experience.
