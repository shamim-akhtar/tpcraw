The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic Pharmaceutical Science student's struggle to understand the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) module.  The student seeks advice on how to improve their understanding and achieve better grades, particularly regarding term tests.  A senior graduate offers suggestions, recommending the student engage directly with their tutor, Mr. Simon, for additional help.

The overall sentiment is one of student frustration and seeking help.  The student expresses significant confusion and a lack of understanding regarding the CGMP module.  The tone is slightly desperate and humorous, using emojis to convey their feelings.  The comments provide a supportive response, suggesting a direct approach to the tutor and emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying principles rather than rote memorization.  The school is referenced indirectly through the mention of the module and the tutor's role within the institution. No specific facilities are mentioned.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management might include the potential for a gap in effective teaching or communication regarding the CGMP module. The student's significant difficulty grasping the material despite having a tutor suggests that the curriculum delivery, teaching style, or supplementary learning resources may require review.  It's recommended that senior management consider reviewing the CGMP module's teaching methodology and resources to ensure its accessibility and effectiveness for all students.  Further investigation into student feedback on Mr. Simon's teaching style, while respecting his privacy, might be considered to improve the overall student learning experience.
