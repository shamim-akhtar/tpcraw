The Reddit post and its comments center on a student's desire to learn field hockey before starting at Temasek Polytechnic to increase their chances of joining the CCA (Co-Curricular Activity).  The primary discussion revolves around finding free practice locations and resources to learn the sport before the school year begins.  The lack of readily available information on suitable practice spaces is a recurring theme.


The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness, albeit limited, with a slightly anxious undertone from the original poster.  While the commenter attempts to offer suggestions like practicing at void decks or using YouTube tutorials, the responses ultimately reflect a lack of specific knowledge about free field hockey resources available to prospective Temasek Polytechnic students.  There is no direct mention of the school's facilities or other aspects beyond the CCA application process.


Based on the limited information, it is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's sports department investigate and potentially address the lack of readily available information about suitable and accessible practice spaces for prospective CCA members.  A simple FAQ or resource page on the school website, outlining potential practice locations (including those on or near campus, if applicable), or even introductory workshops/sessions could significantly improve the student experience and ease the anxieties of prospective CCA participants.  Furthermore, clarifying the CCA application process and criteria could also alleviate concerns.
