The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the challenges of learning field hockey before starting at Temasek Polytechnic and joining the CCA.  The original poster seeks free places to practice and advice on getting started, while a commenter suggests practicing at void decks or watching YouTube tutorials,  acknowledging the CCA's preference for experienced players.  The commenter ultimately admits to lacking personal field hockey experience.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness but also a degree of uncertainty. While the commenter attempts to provide some suggestions, the lack of definitive answers reflects a potential gap in readily available resources for prospective students interested in joining sports CCAs. There's no direct mention of Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or school-related issues beyond the CCA's preference for experienced players.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management: Consider creating more accessible resources for prospective students interested in joining sports CCAs. This could include information on free or low-cost practice locations, introductory workshops or training sessions before the academic year begins, or clear guidelines about the selection process for CCAs, particularly regarding experience requirements and how prospective members can showcase their potential even without prior experience. This would improve the onboarding experience for students interested in extracurricular activities and potentially increase participation.
