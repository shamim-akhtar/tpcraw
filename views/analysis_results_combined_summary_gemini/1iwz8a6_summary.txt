The Reddit post and comments center on the perceived difficulty of an EM2 exam at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original post sarcastically claims the exam was easy, while comments reveal significant student frustration and a stark contrast between the exam's content and past year papers.  Students expressed feelings of being unprepared and surprised by the exam's difficulty.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing anger, frustration, and disbelief regarding the EM2 exam.  The emotional tone is one of shock and disappointment, with comments using hyperbolic language like "4th degree burns" to describe the experience. Students felt betrayed by the exam's deviation from previous years' papers. The specific subject mentioned is EM2 (presumably an engineering module), and the comments implicitly criticize the exam's design and its lack of similarity to past papers, indirectly reflecting on the quality of teaching materials or exam preparation provided.  No specific facilities are mentioned.

It is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic senior management investigate the significant student dissatisfaction surrounding the EM2 exam.  A review of the exam paper's design and its alignment with past year papers and the course curriculum is crucial.  Analysis should include feedback mechanisms beyond the Reddit post to gauge the overall student experience and identify potential areas for improvement in exam preparation materials and teaching methods for EM2.  Transparency regarding the exam's design and rationale would help address student concerns and rebuild trust.
