The Reddit post and comments center on the perceived difficulty of the EM2 exam at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original post ironically claims the exam was easy, a sentiment directly contradicted by the comments which express significant frustration and surprise at the exam's divergence from past year papers.  The comments reveal a general feeling of unpreparedness and disappointment among students.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing anger, frustration, and disbelief.  Students felt betrayed by the exam's deviation from past papers, leading to feelings of being unfairly assessed.  The comments highlight a specific concern about the exam's content not aligning with previous years, impacting student preparedness.  There's no direct mention of specific school facilities or other aspects beyond the EM2 exam itself.

Based on student feedback, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the EM2 exam's design and alignment with past years' papers. The significant disconnect between student expectations and the exam's content suggests a potential flaw in exam preparation resources or the exam's construction itself.  A thorough investigation into the exam's creation and the feedback received should be undertaken to prevent similar issues in future semesters.  Consideration should be given to providing students with better resources or more accurate representation of exam style to avoid future negative experiences.
