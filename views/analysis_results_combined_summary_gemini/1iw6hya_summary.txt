The Reddit post and comments center on the Global Studies program for Communication Design and Future (CDF) students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main discussion revolves around the limited options for global study destinations, specifically the apparent restriction to Indonesia (Medan) and Laos, prompting questions and expressions of surprise from other students.

The overall sentiment is one of mild disappointment and confusion.  While the original poster expresses excitement about Medan, the comment reveals a sense of frustration and limited choice among students.  The limited options for global studies are the central point of contention, with no direct positive or negative comments made about the school's facilities or overall learning experience beyond this particular program element.

Based on the limited information provided, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the available options for global studies within the CDF program. The apparent restriction to only two destinations, Indonesia and Laos, raises concerns about the program's breadth and appeal to students.  An investigation into the reasons for this limitation and exploring the possibility of expanding the global study destinations to offer students a wider range of choices would be beneficial.
