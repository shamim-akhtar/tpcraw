The Reddit post and its comment discuss the options available to Communication Design and Film (CDF) students at Temasek Polytechnic for their global studies program.  The original post expresses excitement about the Medan, Indonesia option, while a comment expresses disappointment at the limited choices of Indonesia and Laos.  The main focus is on student choice and perceived limitations within the global studies program.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While the original poster expresses positive anticipation, the comment reveals frustration and a sense of limited options.  There's a slightly negative undertone stemming from the commenter's feeling that only two destinations (Indonesia and Laos) are available for their batch, indicating a potential lack of diversity in the global studies program offerings. No specific mention is made of school facilities or other aspects of Temasek Polytechnic beyond the global studies program itself.


Given the commenter's disappointment regarding limited global studies destinations (Indonesia and Laos only), I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic senior management review the range of international partnerships for the CDF program.  Expanding the number and variety of locations offered for the global studies program would likely improve student satisfaction and broaden the learning experience.  Investigating the reasons behind the limited choices—whether budget constraints, partner institution availability, or other factors—is crucial to finding a sustainable solution.
