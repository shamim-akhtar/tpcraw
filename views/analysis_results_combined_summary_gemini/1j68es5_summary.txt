The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concern about gaining admission to Temasek Polytechnic's School of Applied Science (SIT) pharmaceutical engineering, chemical engineering, or nursing programs with a low GPA (2.84).  The author seeks advice on their chances of acceptance, highlighting their extensive work experience in a clinic and at Liho as potential mitigating factors.  There are no actual comments provided in the supplied text to analyze further.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and apprehension. The author expresses significant worry about their low GPA impacting their application.  The emotional tone is pleading, demonstrated by the repeated use of "Please help me."  The mention of Temasek Polytechnic focuses specifically on the difficulty of admission to the mentioned SIT courses.  No specific facilities are discussed.  There is implicit concern about the competitiveness of admission to these programs.

Given the lack of comments, specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are limited. However, the post highlights a potential issue: applicants with relevant work experience may be disadvantaged by a solely GPA-based admissions system.  The senior management may want to review the admissions criteria to ensure a holistic assessment that considers work experience alongside academic performance, especially for competitive programs like Pharmaceutical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.  This could improve the fairness and inclusivity of the admissions process.
