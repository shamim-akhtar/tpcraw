The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concerns about applying to Temasek Polytechnic's School of Informatics & IT (SIT) for pharmaceutical engineering, chemical engineering, or nursing with a low GPA (2.84).  The author seeks reassurance regarding their chances of acceptance, highlighting their extensive work experience as a mitigating factor.  Comments (not provided) would likely offer advice, experiences, or insights into the admissions process and GPA requirements for these courses at Temasek Polytechnic.


The overall sentiment is anxious and apprehensive. The author expresses significant worry about their low GPA affecting their application.  The mention of work experience in a clinic and Liho aims to present a positive counterpoint to the academic shortfall. The reference to SIT and the specific courses (pharmaceutical engineering, chemical engineering, and nursing) highlights a focused interest within the Polytechnic. There's a plea for help and reassurance, suggesting a negative emotional tone driven by uncertainty about their future.


Based solely on the post, a recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management would be to review the admissions criteria for SIT's engineering and nursing courses. Specifically, consider whether the current emphasis on GPA adequately balances with relevant work experience, particularly for mature students. A clearer articulation of the admissions process and the weighting given to different application components (GPA, work experience, etc.) may alleviate student anxiety and improve transparency.  This would ensure a fair assessment of all applicants and potentially attract more qualified students with diverse backgrounds.
