The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concern about completing a required medical checkup before the start of their term at Temasek Polytechnic, complicated by an overseas trip.  The student seeks advice on how to proceed, and subsequent comments reflect a shared frustration with the lack of timely response from the admissions office regarding this process.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and frustration. The student expresses worry about missing the deadline for their medical checkup, while the comment from user RaspberryOk3853 highlights a broader issue of poor communication and responsiveness from Temasek Polytechnic's admissions department. The emotional tone is predominantly negative, characterized by pleas for help and expressions of growing concern over a lack of response.  No specific mention is made of school facilities or other aspects of the institution beyond the admissions office's communication practices.

I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic senior management review the responsiveness of their admissions department.  The prolonged lack of response to student inquiries regarding a mandatory medical checkup is unacceptable.  Improving communication channels and response times, perhaps by implementing an automated response system or increasing staffing levels, should be prioritized to alleviate student anxiety and ensure a smoother enrollment process.  A clear and easily accessible procedure for handling such situations, especially those involving unforeseen circumstances like overseas travel, should also be developed and publicized.
