The Reddit post and comments center on the difficulty of joining Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) volleyball CCA, specifically the competitive team. The author expresses concern about their lack of official competition experience in secondary school, despite having volleyball academy experience and unofficial game experience.  Comments highlight a perceived pre-selection process where applicants without prior competitive experience are filtered out before trials even begin, leaving the trials seemingly meaningless.  The question of whether a recreational team exists is also raised.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and disappointment.  The author expresses worry about their chances of joining the volleyball CCA due to their lack of formal competitive experience. The comments reinforce this negative sentiment, portraying the selection process as unfair and discouraging.  The term "competitive af" reflects the perceived high level of competition within the TP volleyball CCA.  There is no positive mention of the school, its facilities, or the overall experience beyond the implied high skill level of the volleyball team.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The comments suggest a potential issue with the transparency and fairness of the volleyball CCA selection process.  The claim that the selection is largely decided before trials even begin, based solely on prior competitive experience, raises concerns about equal opportunities for all applicants.  Senior management should review the selection process to ensure fairness and transparency, perhaps by considering a more inclusive approach that values diverse skill levels and experiences, potentially including recreational teams to cater to a wider range of student interests and abilities.  The possibility of a completely non-competitive volleyball option, or a better defined selection criteria shared upfront, should also be examined to alleviate applicant anxiety.
