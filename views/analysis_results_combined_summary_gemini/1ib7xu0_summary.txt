The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concern about applying to Temasek Polytechnic's Biomedical Science program (B.Med Science) while having partial red-green color blindness.  The student worries about failing the medical check-up and wants to know if their second and third choices (IT-related courses) will still be considered, or if the Polytechnic will assign a different course.  Comments offer anecdotal evidence of a similar situation, suggesting that course assignment might depend on medical eligibility and the availability of suitable alternatives.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty. The student expresses worry about their medical suitability for their desired course and the potential consequences for their application.  The comments offer some reassurance but also highlight the potential for the Polytechnic to override the student's choices based on medical requirements.  There's mention of the school's admission office and the need to directly contact them for clarification.  No specific facilities are discussed, but the discussion focuses on the course selection process and medical eligibility criteria, implicitly involving the school's admission procedures and medical check-up facilities.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Improve the clarity of the course application process and its interaction with medical requirements.  Consider providing more transparent information to prospective students about the specific medical requirements for each course and the implications of failing a medical check-up, particularly regarding the handling of alternative course choices.  A proactive communication strategy that addresses anxieties about medical suitability during the application process could alleviate student stress and enhance the application experience.  Specifically, the website or application materials should explicitly state whether alternative course choices will be considered or if a suitable course will be assigned in the event of a failed medical check-up.
