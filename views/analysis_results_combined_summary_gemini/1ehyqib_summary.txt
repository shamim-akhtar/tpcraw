The Reddit post and comments center on the process of obtaining "seal points" – likely a reward system for extracurricular activities – at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) for participation in an external volunteer event not directly managed by the school.  The original poster is unsure who to contact to claim the points, as the external event organizer doesn't have a designated point of contact for this process.  Comments offer suggestions, advising the poster to contact either their care person (CP) or the external event organizer for assistance in obtaining the points.

The overall sentiment is helpful and informative.  While the original poster expresses confusion and uncertainty regarding the seal points allocation process, the comments provide practical advice and solutions.  There's a generally positive tone, suggesting a supportive community within the r/TemasekPoly subreddit. The discussion directly involves the school's seal point system, and indirectly touches upon the interaction between students and their care persons (CPs), suggesting the potential need for clearer communication regarding external event point allocation.  The TPOSS system (likely a student portal or system) is also mentioned, indicating its role in the process.

Concerns regarding the seal points system's clarity and efficiency arise.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider reviewing the process for obtaining seal points for participation in external events.  Specifically, clearer guidelines should be provided to students regarding who to contact (event organizer, CP, or a central point) and the necessary documentation for claim.   The role of TPOSS in this process should be clarified, and its user-friendliness assessed to ensure a smooth and streamlined process for students.  Finally, improving communication between the school and external event organizers to facilitate seal point allocation could significantly improve the student experience.
