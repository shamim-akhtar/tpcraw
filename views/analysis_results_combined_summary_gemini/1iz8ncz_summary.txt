The Reddit post and comments center around the submission of passport photos and parental consent forms for enrollment at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Students are confused about the submission process, deadlines, and the consequences of late submission.  Specific questions revolve around where to send the documents, whether all forms must be submitted together, and the implications of missing the deadlines.  Several students express anxiety and stress about meeting the requirements.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and confusion.  Students express significant stress and worry about meeting deadlines and potential consequences, such as course withdrawal.  The comments reveal a lack of clarity regarding the submission process, with many relying on anecdotal information and peer-to-peer support rather than clear official communication from the school.  The mention of a TP Telegram group suggests an unofficial information channel is being used, indicating a potential gap in official communication.  There is no direct negative sentiment towards the school itself, but rather towards the perceived lack of clear and timely information regarding enrolment procedures.  Facilities are not directly mentioned, but the lack of clarity in the enrolment process indirectly impacts the student experience.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Review and improve the clarity of enrollment instructions regarding the submission of documents like passport photos and parental consent forms.  The current system appears confusing and stressful for students, leading to significant anxiety and reliance on unofficial communication channels.  Consider consolidating all submission processes into a single, easily accessible online portal or form.  Improve communication regarding deadlines and consequences of late submission, ensuring that all students receive clear and timely information.  The existence of a Telegram group used by students to communicate about enrolment processes suggests a communication gap that needs to be addressed. Consider more proactive communication methods to alleviate student stress and ensure everyone has access to timely and accurate information.
