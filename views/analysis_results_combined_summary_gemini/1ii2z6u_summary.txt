The Reddit post and comments primarily center around students of Temasek Polytechnic (TP) seeking to connect with others in their cohort or course.  Specifically, several students enrolled in the Computer Engineering (CEN) course for the year 2025 are looking to form a chat group, preferably on Telegram, to make friends before the start of school.  There's also mention of students in the Hospitality, Tourism, and Management (HTM) course expressing similar interest in connecting with peers.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic.  Students express excitement about starting school and a clear desire to build friendships before classes begin.  The comments reveal a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. While no specific criticisms of the school, facilities, or courses are mentioned, the underlying theme hints at a need for more readily accessible platforms for students to connect prior to the start of the academic year.

No specific recommendations for senior management are warranted based on the provided content. The post reflects a common student experience of seeking peer connections, not a systemic issue within the institution.
