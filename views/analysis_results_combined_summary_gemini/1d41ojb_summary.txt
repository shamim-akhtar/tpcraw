No specific concerns are raised about the school, its facilities, or its administration.  There is no negativity directed toward Temasek Polytechnic itself.


No recommendations for senior management are necessary based on the provided content. The discussion pertains solely to a student's question about obtaining a CCA shirt and does not reveal any systemic issues within the Polytechnic.
