The Reddit post and comments center on a student-created website, TPConnect, designed to connect Temasek Polytechnic (TP) students based on their courses and academic needs, facilitating peer tutoring and social interaction.  The website also includes a forum for discussing school-related matters.  Several comments highlight technical issues, such as website functionality on mobile devices and connection/live chat problems, while others offer positive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

The overall sentiment is largely positive, with users expressing appreciation for the concept and the creator's efforts.  However, there's a significant undercurrent of concern regarding the website's functionality, specifically its usability on mobile devices and issues with the connections and live chat features. The comments show a mix of excitement ("Interesting project"), humor ("so cute lol"), and constructive criticism ("I love that the conceptâ€¦but are you able to make the website more mobile friendly").  The school itself is not directly criticized, but the success of the website, intended to enhance student life at TP, is directly tied to resolving the identified technical issues.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider facilitating the improvement and adoption of TPConnect. Addressing the reported technical issues, specifically ensuring mobile-friendliness and resolving the problems with the connection and live chat features, is crucial for the website's success.  The website, if fully functional, could significantly enhance the student experience by providing a valuable platform for peer-to-peer learning and social interaction.  Exploring the possibility of officially supporting or integrating TPConnect into the school's existing infrastructure could be beneficial, potentially leveraging the student's initiative for the betterment of the student body.
