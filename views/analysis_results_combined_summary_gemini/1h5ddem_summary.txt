The Reddit post and comments center on criticisms of the Data Science and Analytics (DSAG) module at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students express concerns about the perceived uselessness of the module's content, citing overly short Jupyter notebook notes relying heavily on ChatGPT and pre-recorded videos.  The assessments are criticized as being primarily multiple-choice questions with a single, excessively lengthy project, leading to student disengagement.  A lack of effective teaching and inefficient class time are also major points of contention.

The overall sentiment is strongly negative, expressing frustration and disappointment with the DSAG module.  Students describe feeling bored and disengaged, using terms like "useless," "falling asleep," and describing classes as a waste of time. The emotional tone ranges from apathy ("no point in attending") to mild anger ("ChatGPT response").  Specific criticisms target the teaching methods (reliance on pre-recorded videos and ChatGPT), the length and nature of the project assignment, and the perceived redundancy with a prior module (COMT).  The school's facilities are not directly discussed, but the implied inefficiency in class time suggests a possible lack of optimal resource allocation.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the concerns raised about the DSAG module.  Specifically, they should review the curriculum design, focusing on the perceived redundancy with COMT and the excessive reliance on ChatGPT and pre-recorded videos in place of interactive teaching. The length and design of the project assignment should also be examined to ensure it aligns with the learning objectives and student workload. Finally,  the feedback mechanism should be assessed; the student's experience of receiving a seemingly automated response from the Senior Lecturer (SL) suggests a need for improvement in addressing student concerns effectively.
