The Reddit post and its comments primarily concern the inappropriateness of the post's content and placement within the subreddit.  Users overwhelmingly express confusion and frustration, suggesting the post is off-topic, irrelevant, and possibly a troll attempt. There is no discussion about Temasek Polytechnic itself.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and dismissive.  The comments range from confusion ("What the skibidi?") to outright accusations of trolling and being in the wrong subreddit.  There is no positive sentiment, nor any discussion of the school, its facilities, or any academic or extracurricular aspects.  The single mention of "Raquel Martinez" appears to be unrelated to the subreddit or the school.

No concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted as the post and comments are entirely unrelated to the institution.  The post appears to be a misuse of the subreddit and should be addressed by the subreddit moderators, but not the school administration.
