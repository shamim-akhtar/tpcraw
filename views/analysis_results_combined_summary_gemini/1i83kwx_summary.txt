The Reddit post and comments primarily focus on determining the orientation dates for Temasek Polytechnic (TP) in 2025.  The original poster (OP), a prospective student in the Social Sciences (Psychology) course, is seeking this information to plan around a potential overseas trip with their mother.  Several commenters provide helpful information, including a link to the official TP academic calendar and specific dates for the orientation based on prior experience.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful.  Commenters readily offer assistance and information to the OP, creating a supportive and welcoming online community for prospective TP students.  There is excitement expressed by the OP and another commenter about attending the same course.  No negative sentiment or criticism is directed toward the school, its facilities, or its administration.  The focus remains squarely on practical information regarding orientation scheduling.

No specific recommendations for senior management are warranted based on this post and its comments.  The interaction demonstrates a functional and informative online platform for prospective students seeking information, highlighting the helpfulness of the TP online community.
