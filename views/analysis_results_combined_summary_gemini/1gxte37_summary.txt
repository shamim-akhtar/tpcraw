The Reddit post and comments center on experiences with multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes targeting Temasek Polytechnic (TP) students and alumni via LinkedIn and direct recruitment.  Discussions focus on the deceptive nature of these schemes, which promise financial freedom but ultimately benefit only those at the top of the pyramid structure.  Specific examples of recruitment tactics, financial losses, and the manipulative nature of the presentations are shared.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and wary.  Commenters express frustration, suspicion, and concern about the prevalence of these MLM scams within the TP community.  The emotional tone is one of caution and shared warning, with multiple users describing their own encounters with these schemes and advising others to be vigilant.  While Temasek Polytechnic itself isn't directly criticized, the association of these scams with TP students raises concerns about the safety and well-being of its student body.  No specific issues with TP facilities are mentioned.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider implementing measures to protect students from MLM scams.  This could include:  (1)  Raising awareness through campus-wide announcements, workshops, or online resources about identifying and avoiding MLM schemes.  (2)  Partnering with student organizations to disseminate information and encourage reporting of suspicious activities. (3) Collaborating with LinkedIn to flag potentially fraudulent recruitment attempts targeting TP students and alumni. Addressing this issue proactively could enhance student safety and the reputation of the institution.
