The Reddit post centers on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's confusion regarding the curriculum for the Fashion Management and Design course and the Common Design Programme (CDP).  The student is concerned about the differing Year 1 curricula and seeks clarification on how the courses relate, particularly the possibility of transferring from CDP to Fashion Management and Design in Year 2.  Comments provide clarification that the first semester of Year 1 is a common foundation for all design courses, followed by course selection for CDP students in the second semester.


The overall sentiment is one of initial anxiety and confusion from the student ("I need help ðŸ˜­"), quickly shifting to relief and gratitude after receiving helpful information ("ohh thank you so much! ðŸ˜­").  The comments reveal a supportive and understanding community, with a former CDP student offering assistance and relating to the student's initial confusion.  There is no negative sentiment expressed towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, its facilities, or any specific subjects other than the initial confusion about the curriculum structure.


No specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted based on this post and comments. The confusion arises from a lack of student understanding of the curriculum structure, not from a flaw in the curriculum itself.  The existing system of a common foundation year followed by specialized courses appears to be functional and the clarifying comments effectively address the student's concern.
