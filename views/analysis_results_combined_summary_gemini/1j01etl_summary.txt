The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the career prospects of Temasek Polytechnic (TP) students, specifically those in the Communication Design and Film (CDF) program, focusing on the decision of whether to stay in Singapore or pursue opportunities abroad.  The conversation centers on comparing the stability and work-life balance in Singapore with the higher salaries and faster career growth potentially available in countries like the US and Europe.


The overall sentiment is a balanced and realistic assessment of the Singaporean job market. While acknowledging the stability and networking opportunities within Singapore, particularly in government and finance, the comments express a sense of potential stagnation for those seeking rapid career advancement and higher salaries.  The commenter's experience highlights the value of using Singapore as a stepping stone for international career opportunities. There's no direct mention of TP's facilities or school environment itself; the focus remains solely on post-graduation career paths.


No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted based on the provided text.  The discussion does not directly criticize the school or its curriculum, but rather focuses on broader career considerations relevant to graduates regardless of their specific institution.
