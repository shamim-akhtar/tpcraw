Concerns and Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:

The high level of student distress regarding the "CYFUN" assignment, particularly Task D, suggests potential issues with the curriculum or teaching methods.  The frequent mentions of connection timeouts and difficulties configuring the IIS FTP server point to a lack of clarity or insufficient support in the provided materials and practical sessions.  Management should review the assignment's instructions, supporting documentation, and practical exercises to ensure they are clear, comprehensive, and effective. Additional support resources, such as dedicated help sessions or online tutorials, should be considered to alleviate student anxiety and improve learning outcomes.  The feedback highlights the need for a more robust approach to teaching complex technical skills.  The recurrence of similar issues across multiple students points to a systemic problem that requires investigation and remediation.  A survey of student experiences with the assignment could help identify specific areas for improvement.
