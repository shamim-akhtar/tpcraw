The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's inability to access Statista, a statistical database, using their TP account.  The student reports being able to access the website but requires payment to view reports and data, implying a lack of institutional access or a problem with their account credentials.  The comments attempt to clarify the nature of the access issue.

The overall sentiment is one of frustration and mild desperation from the student, expressed through the use of crying emojis ("ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­").  The comments are helpful and attempt to diagnose the problem, maintaining a neutral and somewhat supportive tone.  The issue specifically relates to accessing Statista, a resource presumably provided or expected to be accessible through the polytechnic. No other school facilities or subjects beyond the need for statistics for an assignment are mentioned.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management: Investigate why this student, and potentially other students, cannot access Statista using their TP accounts.  Verify if the intended institutional access is correctly configured and if students have been properly informed on the procedures for accessing Statista without incurring personal costs.  Providing clear instructions and troubleshooting support for accessing online resources like Statista is crucial for student success.  This situation highlights a potential gap in IT support or communication regarding access to essential research databases.
