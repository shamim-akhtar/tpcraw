The Reddit post and comments center on the Aerospace Electronics (AE) diploma offered at Temasek Polytechnic. The author, seeking to understand the program before an interview, expresses anxiety about the interview process and the program's curriculum.  A commenter, a former student, provides insight into the course's structure, highlighting its strong Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) foundation and introductory aerospace modules with an electronics focus. The commenter also mentions the rapid obsolescence of the field, suggesting the author leverage this knowledge during the interview.

The overall sentiment is one of apprehension and seeking help. The author expresses nervousness about the upcoming AE interview, contrasting it with the more values-based questions experienced in their Aviation Management interview.  The commenter's response is helpful and reassuring, offering practical advice, albeit with a slightly cynical undertone regarding the rapid obsolescence of the AE curriculum.  No specific negative sentiments regarding school facilities or the general reputation of Temasek Polytechnic are expressed.

Based on the commenter’s statement about 40% of the AE curriculum becoming obsolete by graduation, a recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management would be to review the Aerospace Electronics curriculum’s relevance and update frequency.  A curriculum review should focus on ensuring the taught skills and knowledge remain current within the industry and actively reflect advancements in aerospace electronics. This will improve graduate employability and reduce student anxieties about the course’s long-term value.
