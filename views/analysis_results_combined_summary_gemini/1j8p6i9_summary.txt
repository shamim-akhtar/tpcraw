The Reddit post and comments primarily concern the scheduling and logistics of Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Orientation (ORI) for the 2025 intake.  Students are confused about conflicting dates for ORI (8 April and 15-17 April), the location of the Bedok Reservoir event (if any), and how to access and use the TP OEI app for information.  Difficulties logging into the app and creating the required student email address are also highlighted.  The confusion stems from a lack of clear communication regarding different ORI sessions for various schools and programs, specifically referencing the TP School of Professional and Lifelong Learning (TPSUL) orientation.


The overall sentiment is one of confusion and frustration. Students express anxiety and uncertainty about the conflicting dates and lack of clear information.  Negative emotions are expressed concerning the unclear communication from the school and the difficulties accessing crucial information via the TP OEI app and student email setup.  The mention of the Bedok Reservoir event is brief and doesn't evoke strong sentiment.  The TP OEI app is criticised for its inaccessibility and lack of comprehensive information. The school's communication (or lack thereof) regarding ORI scheduling and the TPSUL's separate orientation is a recurring source of frustration.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the issues raised regarding ORI communication and accessibility of information.  Specifically:

1. **Clarify ORI scheduling:**  Improve communication regarding the different ORI dates (8 April vs 15-17 April), explaining clearly which dates apply to which schools and programs. This should include detailed information on the purpose of each session and the required attendance.  This should be communicated proactively via email and updated clearly on the TP OEI app.

2. **Improve TP OEI app usability:** Investigate and resolve the reported issues with accessing the TP OEI app, including issues with login credentials and information clarity.  Ensure the app provides a comprehensive and easily accessible ORI schedule for all students.

3. **Streamline student email setup:**  Simplify the process of creating the required student email address, providing clearer instructions within the enrollment package and potentially offering additional support channels.  This includes addressing the reported limitations on email providers (hotmail.com or outlook.com).

4. **Enhance communication channels:** Evaluate existing communication channels and explore additional methods (e.g., FAQs, dedicated ORI helpdesk) to address student queries effectively and proactively.  A unified, readily accessible communication strategy should be implemented.
