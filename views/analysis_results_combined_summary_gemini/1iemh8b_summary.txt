The Reddit post and comments center on concerns regarding the Information Technology (IIT) program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main issues raised include a perceived sudden increase in negative posts about the IIT program this year, coinciding with a syllabus change.  Specific complaints focus on inconsistent grading and feedback for projects and tests, insufficient teaching of crucial project components before deadlines, poor communication between lecturers leading to conflicting instructions, unequal access to project consultations, and teachers reacting poorly to student questions.  Furthermore, the anonymity of student feedback is questioned, with some claiming their feedback was not anonymous.


The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and frustrated.  The emotional tone ranges from incredulous to angry and cynical.  Students express feelings of being unheard and unfairly treated by lecturers, describing teachers as "power-tripping" and the school administration as unresponsive and only concerned with collecting money ("shake leg collect money").  Specific mentions include the IIT program, its syllabus, project specifications, teacher-student interactions, feedback mechanisms, and the alleged lack of anonymity in student feedback. The facilities are not directly mentioned, however the effectiveness of teaching and learning within the existing structure is heavily criticized.


Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Immediately investigate the claims of inconsistent grading, feedback issues, and conflicting instructions within the IIT program.  Verify the anonymity of student feedback mechanisms and address concerns regarding the lack of anonymity and potential repercussions for negative feedback.  Review the IIT syllabus and teaching methods to ensure sufficient preparation time for major projects and improve communication between lecturers.  Implement a system for ensuring equal access to project consultations for all students.  Finally, conduct training for lecturers on effective communication and student interaction, emphasizing respectful responses to student questions and concerns.  Addressing these issues will likely improve student satisfaction and the overall reputation of the IIT program.
