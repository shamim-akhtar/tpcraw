The Reddit post and comments center around a student's anxiety regarding the lack of response after taking the Temasek Polytechnic (TP) aptitude test for the Aerospace Electronics course.  The main concern is whether the lack of communication means rejection from the Early Admission Exercise (EAE).  Comments offer reassurance, sharing experiences of late interview invitations from previous years and emphasizing the importance of perseverance and passion.  However, there's also a troll comment suggesting failure, leading to further discussion and condemnation.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty mixed with supportive encouragement. The student expresses considerable stress ("extremely stressed," "rlly need eae").  Other commenters attempt to alleviate this by sharing their similar experiences and offering hope.  The  mention of the aptitude test itself is described as "horrendous" and "stressful," highlighting concerns about the test's difficulty and time constraints.  Positive comments focus on the hope that passion and interest will prevail, while the negative comment highlights a lack of timely communication from the school. There is no direct mention of specific school facilities.


**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

The experience highlights a communication gap that is causing significant student anxiety.  Senior management should review the communication strategy following aptitude tests, ensuring clearer and more timely updates to applicants, regardless of outcome.  Consider providing regular updates via email or a dedicated online portal. Additionally, analyze the difficulty and time constraints of the aptitude test for the Aerospace Electronics course.  Student feedback regarding the test's stressfulness ("horrendous," "stressful") suggests a potential need for revision or improved clarity to reduce unnecessary anxiety.  Finally, address the issue of disruptive and negative comments online by monitoring platforms like Reddit and employing appropriate measures to maintain a supportive environment for applicants.
