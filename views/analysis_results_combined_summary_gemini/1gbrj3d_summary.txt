The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss student preferences for canteens at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The author is conducting a math project requiring data on canteen choices and solicits participation via a provided online form.  Comments reveal popular canteens among students from different schools within TP (HSS, IIT, Design, Engine School), highlight the convenience of Flavours canteen due to its proximity to classes and halal options, and mention the closure of the Business School canteen.  A separate discussion emerges regarding the challenges of using Venn diagrams in a math project.


The overall sentiment is generally positive and helpful.  Students readily offer their canteen preferences, demonstrating a willingness to assist the author with their project.  There's a mix of lightheartedness and concern. While Flavours canteen receives significant positive feedback for its halal options and convenience, the closure of the Business School canteen evokes a slightly negative sentiment.  The discussion around Venn diagrams shifts the tone to one of caution and shared academic experience, particularly regarding the difficulty of the topic.  Specific facilities mentioned include the Flavours, IIT, Design, Engine, and Business School canteens.


Based on the comments, I recommend the following for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:

1. **Assess the impact of the Business School canteen closure:** The comments suggest the closure negatively impacted students, especially those from HSS who frequented it for snacks.  Investigating the reason for closure and exploring options to mitigate student inconvenience is recommended.

2. **Consider student feedback on canteen choices:** The strong preference for Flavours highlights its popularity.  Analyzing this data could inform future canteen planning and resource allocation.  Investigating why certain canteens are favored over others (e.g., proximity, food variety, halal options) could also provide valuable insights for improvements across all canteens.
