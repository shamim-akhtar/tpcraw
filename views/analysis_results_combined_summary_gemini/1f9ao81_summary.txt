The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Year 1 student's struggles in their Information and Interactive Technology (IIT) course, specifically the COMT module.  The student expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and behind their peers, questioning their aptitude for coding.  Comments offer a mix of encouragement, practical advice on improving coding skills, and relatable experiences from other TP IIT students, along with some discussion on the relative difficulty and job prospects of IIT versus business courses.  There are also mentions of the competitiveness of the IT job market in Singapore.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty, particularly concerning the student's academic performance and future prospects. While many comments offer support and reassurance, the underlying tone reflects the challenging nature of the IIT course, specifically COMT.  The student's self-doubt is palpable, and several comments echo similar struggles, highlighting a potentially widespread issue within the IIT program.  The school's facilities (labs) are mentioned positively as a resource for improvement, but there is no discussion of specific physical facilities or aspects of the school's infrastructure.  The difficulty of the COMT module is repeatedly highlighted as a major source of stress.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The high number of comments expressing similar difficulties with the COMT module in the IIT course warrants investigation. A review of the COMT curriculum and teaching methods should be conducted to assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.  Consider offering additional support resources, such as supplemental tutorials or workshops, specifically targeting students struggling with foundational coding concepts.  Furthermore, exploring student feedback mechanisms beyond Reddit, such as anonymous surveys, could provide valuable insights into students' learning experiences and identify systematic issues affecting student success within the IIT program.  Finally, a broader review of career guidance and support could help students make more informed course selections and manage expectations about job market realities.
