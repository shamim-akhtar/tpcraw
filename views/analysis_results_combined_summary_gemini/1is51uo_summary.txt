The Reddit post and comments center on the possibility of joining Temasek Polytechnic's basketball CCA (Co-Curricular Activity) without prior experience, specifically aiming for competitive play.  The main discussion revolves around the competitiveness of the trials, the likelihood of success for someone without prior experience, and the difficulty of selection.

The overall sentiment is a mix of cautious optimism and realism.  While the original poster expresses enthusiasm and a desire to participate in competitions, the commenters highlight the highly competitive nature of the basketball CCA trials.  Nothappygooutside provides a realistic assessment of the low probability of success given a lack of prior experience, but offers encouragement. Gceolevels offers a more optimistic perspective, suggesting potential help with selection, implying the trials themselves may include some degree of subjective evaluation.  The facilities are not discussed, nor is there mention of any other aspects of the school beyond the CCA.

While no direct concerns are raised about the school's management, the significant competitiveness of the basketball CCA trials, potentially discouraging participation from students without prior experience, warrants attention.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider reviewing the selection process for sports CCAs to ensure it balances competitiveness with inclusivity and accessibility for students of all skill levels. This could involve evaluating the trial structure, providing better information on participation requirements, or potentially creating pathways for less experienced students to improve their skills and eventually participate in the CCA.
