The Reddit post and comments center on the question of whether Temasek Polytechnic students will have a Youth Day holiday.  The original post expresses uncertainty, while the comments largely express disappointment and a lack of a holiday.  There is no discussion of specific school facilities, programs, or other aspects of the Polytechnic beyond the holiday itself.

The overall sentiment is one of disappointment and mild frustration.  The comments use emojis expressing sadness and resignation ("ðŸ« ", "ðŸ˜­", "Nope"). The emotional tone is lighthearted but negative, focused solely on the absence of a Youth Day holiday and its impact on students' schedules. No positive or negative sentiment towards the school or its facilities is expressed.

There are no specific concerns or recommendations for senior management based on this limited discussion. The issue is a simple one of student expectation versus reality regarding a public holiday.  If there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the holiday, addressing that would be the only relevant action.
