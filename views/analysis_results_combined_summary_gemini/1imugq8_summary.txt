The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's questions regarding the Medical Biotechnology diploma.  Specifically, the student inquires about necessary pre-enrollment preparation in mathematics, chemistry, and biology; the weighting of tests, exams, and projects in GPA calculation; and the environment and requirements of various CCAs (Co-curricular Activities).  Existing students offer advice on course content, exam structures, and CCA experiences.

The overall sentiment is largely helpful and supportive.  Current students provide detailed answers to the prospective student's questions, sharing their experiences with specific modules like MAS (Mathematics in Applied Science) and advising on CCA participation.  While some frustration is expressed regarding the difficulty of certain modules (MAS in particular), the tone is generally positive and encouraging.  There is a lack of direct negative comments about the school or its facilities, although the difficulty of the MAS module is highlighted.  The comments also offer insights into the Applied Science curriculum's hands-on nature.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Consider providing more comprehensive pre-enrollment information for prospective students on the TP website.  The comments highlight the difficulties some students face with the MAS module.  A review of the MAS curriculum and teaching methods might be beneficial to improve student outcomes and reduce the reported stress levels.  Additionally, a clearer articulation of the weighting of assessments (tests, exams, projects) for each diploma could alleviate anxiety for incoming students.  Finally, updating the TP website with detailed descriptions of each CCA, including requirements and typical environments, may enhance the student experience.
