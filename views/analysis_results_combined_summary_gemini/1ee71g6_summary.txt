The Reddit post and comments center on the question of how to properly cite lecture slides used in an essay, specifically within the context of Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster expresses frustration at forgetting the correct citation format after three years of study.  The comments provide practical advice on where to find the necessary citation information.

The overall sentiment is one of mild frustration and uncertainty from the original poster, but the tone remains relatively calm and polite.
