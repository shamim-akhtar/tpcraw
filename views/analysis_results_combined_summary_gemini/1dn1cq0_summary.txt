The Reddit post is a request for participation in a survey on cannabis use conducted by a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student as part of their Global Studies coursework. The comments section is absent, meaning there's no discussion or feedback from other Reddit users regarding the survey, Temasek Polytechnic, or the subject matter.


The overall sentiment is neutral. The post itself is polite and requests help in a non-confrontational manner.  There is no expressed negativity or positivity towards Temasek Polytechnic, its facilities, or the A&F course specifically, as the comments section is empty. The subject matter of cannabis is potentially sensitive, but the post treats it in a straightforward, academic context.


Given the lack of comments, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management.  However, the post highlights the potential for student projects to touch upon sensitive topics.  Senior management might consider providing clearer guidelines or support for students undertaking research on such subjects, ensuring ethical considerations are addressed and appropriate resources are available.  This includes access to relevant academic resources, support for obtaining ethical clearances (if required), and guidance on survey design and data handling to promote responsible research practices.
