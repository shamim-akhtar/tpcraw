The Reddit post and comments primarily center on the competitiveness of gaining entry into the Aerospace Electronics Engineering (AEL) and Aerospace Engineering (AEG) diplomas at Temasek Polytechnic from the Common Engineering Programme (CEP).  The original poster seeks information about the average CGPA required for admission and the typical ranking of AEL/AEG in phase 1 streaming.  One commenter encourages aiming for a high CGPA.

The overall sentiment is anxious and competitive.  The original poster expresses a desire for information to improve their chances of entering a highly sought-after diploma program.  The comment mentioning the competitiveness of the single class further emphasizes the pressure students feel.  There is no explicit mention of specific school facilities or aspects of the school beyond the academic programs (AEL, AEG, CEP) and their competitive nature.

Given the expressed anxiety and competitive nature of the program selection process,  senior management at Temasek Polytechnic may wish to consider providing clearer, more transparent information regarding CGPA requirements and selection processes for programs like AEL and AEG.  This could help alleviate student stress and provide better guidance regarding academic expectations for prospective applicants.  Perhaps publishing historical data or creating more accessible resources about program entry requirements could be beneficial.
