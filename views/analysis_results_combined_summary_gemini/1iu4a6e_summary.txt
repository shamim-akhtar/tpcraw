The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Information Technology (IIT) student's negative experience with a consultancy internship arranged through the school.  The student details excessive unpaid overtime, poor management, lack of mentorship, and unclear project assignments leading to wasted work.  Comments discuss the challenges of finding and securing suitable internships, the varying experiences students have,  and the lack of support from TP in addressing internship issues.  The possibility of legal recourse and the importance of researching companies beforehand are also raised.


The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration, disappointment, and exhaustion regarding the internship experience.  The student's descriptions evoke feelings of being overworked, undervalued, and misled.  While some comments acknowledge the realities of the working world and offer relatable experiences, the predominant tone remains critical of the internship provided by TP and the lack of support offered by the school's liaison officer.  The specific issues mentioned include inadequate pay, excessive overtime, poor management, lack of mentorship, and the overall stressful and unfulfilling nature of the work.  The school's facilities are not directly mentioned, but the implied lack of support from TP's liaison officer suggests a failure in the school's internship placement and support systems.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the concerns raised regarding the internship program.  Specifically, they should review the process for vetting and selecting internship placements, ensuring that companies meet minimum standards for compensation and working conditions.  The role and effectiveness of the liaison officers in supporting students during internships needs evaluation and improvement.  The school should also provide clearer information to students about the potential risks and responsibilities involved in internships, including the possibility of unpaid overtime and the lack of guarantee regarding mentorship quality.  Finally, the school might consider providing resources to help students assess potential internship opportunities and negotiate better terms with employers.
