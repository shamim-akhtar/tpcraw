The Reddit post offers free consultations and mentorship to Temasek Polytechnic (TP) psychology students and other interested polytechnic students.  The services cover academic guidance (excluding providing answers or notes), portfolio building, university admissions (including Early Admissions Exercise or EAE), and general support. The author, a TP psychology graduate now studying psychology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), emphasizes their experience with university admissions and scholarships.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful. The author expresses passion for guiding students and shares their own successful academic journey as evidence of their capabilities.  The comments (which are not provided) are not available for analysis, but the post itself projects a supportive and encouraging tone.  There is no direct mention of specific TP facilities or school-related issues, though the implicit context is one of supporting students navigating the challenges of academic life at TP and the transition to university.


Given the absence of comments, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management.  However, the post highlights a potential student need for additional academic and university admissions support, suggesting that proactive measures to enhance these services could be beneficial.  The high engagement (19 upvotes) indicates student interest in such resources, pointing to a potential area for school investment.
