The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the application process for Temasek Polytechnic's Diploma in Aviation Management (T04) for a JC student who failed their A-Levels.  The main points of confusion revolve around the course's correct name, the application procedure from JC using O-Level results via JAE, the duration of the diploma (2 or 3 years), and the required mathematical and scientific aptitude for the course.  Several commenters clarify the course's existence and provide advice regarding the application process.


The overall sentiment is helpful and informative, with commenters generally offering supportive guidance to the original poster.  While some confusion exists regarding the application process and course duration, the tone is largely positive and encouraging.  There is a mention of the course's engineering focus and the potential difficulty of the first year for students lacking strong math and science backgrounds.  Specific subject concerns are raised regarding the need for strong mathematics skills (particularly H2 Maths), highlighting potential challenges in the first year of the course.  The website's internal server error is mentioned as a source of frustration for the original poster.


Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The website's technical issue causing an "internal server error" should be addressed immediately to avoid misleading prospective students.  Clarification regarding the application process for JC students using O-Level results, specifically concerning JAE and whether a 2 or 3 year programme is available for A-Level students, should be made readily available on the website.  Furthermore, the website should clearly state the recommended prior mathematical knowledge (mentioning the value of H2 Maths) for the Aviation Management programme to help prospective students realistically assess their suitability for the course.  This will improve the transparency and accuracy of information presented to students, avoiding any misinformation.
