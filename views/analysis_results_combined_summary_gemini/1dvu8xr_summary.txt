The Reddit post and comments center on the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) application process for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Aviation Management course.  Specifically, the discussion revolves around an online aptitude test required as part of the EAE application.  Applicants are seeking information on the test's content, format (number of questions, time limit), and its impact on the likelihood of receiving an interview invitation.  Some commenters express concern about not receiving an EAE email, while others offer advice based on their own or their seniors' experiences.

The overall sentiment is a mix of anxiety and uncertainty among the applicants.  There's a prevalent feeling of being unprepared for the aptitude test, with many expressing their cluelessness regarding the test's content.  Positive sentiments arise from current students offering help and sharing past experiences, which offer some reassurance.  The comments showcase a desire for information regarding the test's format, difficulty, and importance in the selection process.  Specific mention is made of the aptitude test's components, such as pattern recognition, basic math, and a perceived time constraint, which seems to be a key source of stress for applicants.  There is no direct mention of school facilities, but the implicit context is about the TP's aviation program and admissions process.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Consider improving communication regarding the EAE application process for the Aviation Management course. The comments highlight significant applicant anxiety stemming from a lack of clear information about the online aptitude test.  Specific recommendations include providing sample questions or a more detailed description of the test's content and format on the TP website or application portal.  Additionally, clarifying the weight given to the aptitude test in the overall selection process would alleviate applicant stress and improve transparency. This would directly address the concerns raised by applicants regarding the testâ€™s difficulty, time constraints, and impact on interview invitations.
