The Reddit post and comments primarily revolve around Temasek Polytechnic's policy on attendance and its impact on grading, specifically concerning "non-graded pass" (NGP) status.  The original poster (OP) received an NGP in a module due to low attendance and inquired about retaking it.  The ensuing discussion clarifies the implications of NGP, highlighting the mandatory 85% attendance requirement for all modules, regardless of whether the module is graded or not.  Debate arises regarding the interpretation of the policy and whether it is possible to graduate without meeting attendance requirements.


The overall sentiment is a mixture of anxiety and frustration from the OP, who is worried about their GPA and the possibility of failing the module.  The comments express a range of reactions, including helpful explanations of the policy, exasperated responses to the OP's lack of awareness, and contentious debates about the policy's interpretation and fairness.  There's concern expressed about the clarity of the policy regarding attendance and its consequences, particularly for engineering students (mentioned by the OP).  Several commenters point to the student handbook as the authoritative source of information and suggest that the OP read it carefully.  The school facilities are not directly discussed, but the 9 am class time is mentioned as a contributing factor to the OP's attendance issue.


**Recommendations for Senior Management at Temasek Polytechnic:**

Review the clarity and accessibility of the attendance policy as it relates to grading and graduation requirements. The significant confusion and debate in the Reddit thread highlight a potential communication gap between the administration and students.  Consider revising the policy document or creating supplementary materials (e.g., FAQs, videos) to ensure that students clearly understand the implications of insufficient attendance, the mandatory 85% threshold for all modules, and the consequences of not meeting it.  The concerns raised about easily circumventing the attendance requirement by self-study warrant an investigation to ensure policy effectiveness in promoting student engagement and learning.  Proactive communication during orientation and the start of each semester, as suggested by commenters, should be reinforced and possibly supplemented with more engaging methods.
