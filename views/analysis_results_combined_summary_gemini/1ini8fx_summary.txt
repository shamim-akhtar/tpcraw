**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

The significant confusion and misinformation surrounding the attendance policy and the consequences of not meeting the 85% requirement necessitate a review of the communication strategy.  The student handbook should be reviewed for clarity, and the information should be presented more concisely and accessibly during orientation and the start of each semester.  Consider supplementing written materials with clear video explanations or interactive tutorials.  Additionally, explore alternative communication methods to reach students who may not fully grasp the implications of the policy, ensuring that all students understand the consequences of not meeting attendance requirements, including the impact on their GPA and potential inability to graduate.  The persistent misunderstanding highlighted in this discussion suggests the need for clearer, more accessible information.
