The Reddit post and comments center on Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) recent restrictions on internet access, specifically focusing on the blocking of games like Roblox and other applications previously accessible through the school's Wi-Fi network.  Users express frustration over the perceived arbitrary nature of the bans, citing the poor quality of the Wi-Fi in general and the impact of the restrictions on their ability to access entertainment during downtime.  Workarounds like using personal VPNs or alternative network connections are discussed.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and frustrated.  Users express anger and disappointment toward TP's IT department and its decisions regarding internet access. The school's Wi-Fi is described as "ass" multiple times, indicating significant dissatisfaction with its performance and reliability, even before the game bans.  The comments reveal a strong reliance on online games for entertainment during school time and the perceived unfairness of the restrictions.  The mention of a specific word search game being banned further highlights the perceived overreach of the restrictions.  The facilities (Wi-Fi network) are directly criticized for both their poor quality and restrictive policies.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the complaints regarding the Wi-Fi's poor performance and unreliable connectivity.  The seemingly arbitrary nature of the game bans, including the banning of previously accessible games after a Wi-Fi restart, warrants review.  Consideration should be given to establishing clearer guidelines for acceptable internet usage, providing students with a more reliable and less restrictive Wi-Fi experience, and potentially addressing student concerns regarding free time entertainment within the school environment.  A transparent communication strategy regarding network policy changes should be implemented to avoid future misunderstandings and negative reactions from students.
