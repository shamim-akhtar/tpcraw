The Reddit post and comments discuss the existence and application of "error carried forward" (ECF) in practical assessments, specifically within the Applied Science and Chemistry (ASC) department at Temasek Polytechnic.  The consensus is that ECF policies aren't uniformly applied and depend heavily on factors like overall cohort performance and the individual academic head's discretion for a given module, particularly in mathematics-related subjects.

The overall sentiment is one of uncertainty and mild concern. While there's no overt negativity, the comments express a lack of clear-cut rules regarding ECF.  The comments suggest a perceived leniency based on cohort performance, implying potential inconsistency in grading standards.  There's no specific mention of school facilities, but the discussion focuses on assessment practices within the ASC department and mathematics modules, highlighting a perceived lack of transparency or consistency in grading policies.

Based on the comments, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the assessment policies for ASC and mathematics-related modules.  Specifically, they should clarify the application of ECF to ensure consistent and transparent grading practices across all cohorts and instructors.  Inconsistency in applying ECF, based on cohort performance, may lead to perceived unfairness and should be addressed to improve student confidence in the assessment process.  Developing clearer guidelines on ECF, potentially including formalized criteria for its application, could mitigate these concerns.
