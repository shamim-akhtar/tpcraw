The Reddit post and comments center on the misconception that Temasek Polytechnic (TP) life is "chill."  The original poster challenges this notion, arguing that the perceived ease depends heavily on the course of study, with design students reportedly having more flexible schedules and holidays compared to students in science, business, or law programs.  The ensuing discussion reveals a wide range of experiences, highlighting the competitive academic environment, particularly for university progression, the demanding workload in various disciplines (especially design courses, contrary to initial perceptions), and the significant time commitment required beyond academics.

The overall sentiment is mixed, swinging between positive and negative.  While some commenters describe their TP experience as relatively relaxed, emphasizing the possibility of a balanced social and academic life, others strongly refute the "chill" narrative, citing intense competition, heavy workloads (especially in design and science-based courses), and the pressure to maintain a high GPA for university admission.  Specific concerns are raised regarding the demanding nature of design courses, conflicting with the initial perception of their relaxed nature.  The quality and intensity of teaching across various disciplines, particularly compared to ITE, also emerges as a point of discussion. Mentions of facilities are minimal, however the overall academic environment and perceived social atmosphere are debated.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider addressing the following:

1. **The perception of course difficulty:**  The significant discrepancy in perceived workload and academic pressure between different diploma programs requires attention.  A more transparent and accurate portrayal of the demands of each course might better prepare prospective students.

2. **Student well-being:**  Multiple comments express concern about the intense competition and heavy workload negatively impacting students' mental health and well-being.  Initiatives promoting work-life balance, stress management, and peer support could be beneficial.  This should include specific measures to improve the support offered to design students facing intense project deadlines.

3. **Course content and workload:** The disparity in content and difficulty between ITE and TP in certain areas suggests the need for a thorough review of curriculum and assessment methods to ensure that the transition is smooth and manageable for students transferring from ITE.  A focus on providing sufficient support and guidance for students struggling with the advanced content could also be helpful.
