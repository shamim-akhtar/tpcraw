The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the possibility of transferring from a full-time Diploma in Business program at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) to a part-time diploma program. The main issue revolves around the feasibility of such a transfer, the process involved, and the potential requirement of prior work experience for admission to part-time programs.


The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and cautious advice. While the original poster expresses difficulty coping with the full-time workload, the comments offer practical suggestions.  The tone is informative and supportive, with commenters directing the original poster to explore the possibility of speaking to their Course Coordinator (CP) and carefully reviewing admission requirements for part-time courses before making any decisions. There is no explicit mention of specific school facilities or subjects beyond the Diploma in Business program itself.


Recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic:  The comments highlight a potential area for improvement in student support.  Consider improving the clarity and accessibility of information regarding inter-program transfers, particularly between full-time and part-time diplomas. This could involve creating a more comprehensive online resource or strengthening advising services to guide students through the transfer process and clearly outline the admission requirements and potential implications for part-time programs, including work experience prerequisites.
