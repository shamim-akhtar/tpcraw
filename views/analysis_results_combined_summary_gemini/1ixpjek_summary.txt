The Reddit post and comments center on a Year 1 Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's inquiry about transferring from a full-time Diploma in Business program to a part-time diploma program due to difficulties managing the workload.  The primary discussion revolves around the feasibility of such a transfer, with suggestions to consult a course advisor and thoroughly research part-time program admission requirements, including potential work experience prerequisites.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and cautious advice.  While the original poster expresses difficulty and frustration with the full-time workload, the comments offer practical guidance rather than negativity.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities, but the underlying concern relates to the academic demands of the full-time program.  The comments highlight the potential obstacles and administrative processes involved in transferring courses within TP.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  The post highlights a student's struggle with the workload of a full-time diploma program.  While the comments provide helpful advice, it underscores the need to improve student support resources regarding course transitions and workload management.  Consider enhancing pre-enrollment counseling to better inform prospective students about the demands of various programs, and providing more accessible and proactive support systems for students experiencing academic difficulties, including clear guidance on transfer options and pathways.  This could include improved online resources and dedicated advising for students considering part-time study.
