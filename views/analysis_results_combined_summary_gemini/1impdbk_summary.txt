The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of students in Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Business diploma program.  Discussions cover the program's competitiveness and culture, workload, job prospects (specifically university acceptance rates and internship opportunities), required equipment, and the quality of specific facilities like the BizPark canteen and designated classroom spaces for specializations.  There's also some inquiry about specific specializations within the Business diploma, namely Marketing and International Trade and Logistics.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While some students express excitement about starting the program, a significant portion paints a picture of intense competition, characterized by "snakes" (meaning backstabbing classmates) and considerable pressure to maintain high grades to secure university entry.  The closure of the BizPark canteen is a recurring negative point, impacting student convenience. Positive comments are limited to the relatively lighter workload compared to other diplomas and the diverse internship opportunities available to business students.  Facilities are generally described negatively â€“ the BizPark closure is highlighted, and the "Marketing Hub" is deemed underwhelming.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

1. **Address the toxic competitive culture within the Business diploma program.**  The recurring mentions of "snakes" and intense pressure suggest a need for intervention.  Initiatives promoting collaboration and a healthier learning environment should be explored.

2. **Re-evaluate the impact of BizPark closure on Business students.**  The lack of a dedicated canteen is a significant concern repeatedly highlighted, negatively affecting student experience and potentially well-being.  Explore alternative solutions to provide adequate catering facilities.

3. **Improve the quality and appeal of designated spaces for specializations within the Business diploma.**  The description of the "Marketing Hub" as a "normal classroom with transparent walls" indicates a need for improved dedicated learning environments for specialized courses.  Investing in more conducive and specialized learning spaces would enhance student experience and productivity.

4. **Provide clearer guidance on internship opportunities and their alignment with specializations.**  While diverse opportunities exist, some confusion remains about the degree of specialization required for internships.  Clearer communication and guidance could reduce student anxiety and improve outcomes.
