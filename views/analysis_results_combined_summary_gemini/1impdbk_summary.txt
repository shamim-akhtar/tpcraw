The Reddit post and comments center on questions about the Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Business diploma program.  The original poster seeks information on the program's curriculum, difficulty, job prospects (specifically university acceptance rates), and necessary equipment.  Comments provide insights into the program's competitive and sometimes cutthroat environment, workload, and the lack of a dedicated canteen due to the closure of BizPark.  Further discussion touches upon the marketing specialization, internship opportunities, and GPA requirements for university admission.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While some students express excitement about starting the program, a significant portion of the comments paint a picture of a highly competitive and stressful environment, characterized by  "snakes" (meaning competitive and backstabbing classmates) and intense pressure to maintain high GPAs for university admission.  The closure of BizPark and the consequent lack of a dedicated canteen are viewed negatively.  Positive mentions include the relatively lighter workload compared to other disciplines and the diverse internship opportunities available.  Specific facilities like the "marketing hub" are described as underwhelming.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Addressing the reported negative aspects of the Business program is crucial. Specifically:

1. **Student Culture:** Investigate the pervasive perception of a cutthroat and competitive environment within the Business program.  Initiatives promoting collaboration and teamwork, rather than individual competition, should be explored.

2. **BizPark Closure Impact:** The closure of BizPark and the resulting lack of a canteen for Business students is a significant concern.  Explore alternative solutions to provide adequate student amenities, such as partnering with nearby establishments or creating a dedicated student space within the main campus.

3. **Curriculum Support:** While the workload is perceived as lighter than other disciplines, the intense pressure to achieve high GPAs for university admission needs consideration.   Review the curriculum and support systems to ensure students receive adequate guidance and resources to manage academic pressure and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
