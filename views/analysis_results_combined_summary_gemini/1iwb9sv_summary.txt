The Reddit post and comments center on choosing and utilizing Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) to enhance university applications.  The original poster seeks recommendations for CCAs that are less demanding yet beneficial for their portfolio, specifically asking if event-based CCAs hold equal weight to those with fixed weekly commitments.  Commenters offer various suggestions, emphasizing the importance of SEAL points, and debate the true impact of a strong CCA portfolio on university admissions.

The overall sentiment is helpful and informative, with a mix of opinions regarding the significance of CCAs in university applications.  While many commenters suggest numerous CCAs like the Community Service Club, TP Lionhearters, TP Sustainability Interest Group (TPSUStig), and course-specific interest groups, emphasizing their event-based nature and ease of participation,  a crucial dissenting voice highlights that a strong GPA is paramount for university entrance, with the portfolio playing a secondary role, mainly for scholarship applications.  The discussion includes mentions of specific TP facilities (implicitly through the CCA descriptions) and the SEAL point system.  There's also some confusion and conflicting information on the true weight of a strong portfolio versus GPA, specifically within the competitive context of Law and Management programs.

Based on the conflicting information about the relative importance of CCAs and GPA in university admissions, I recommend Temasek Polytechnic senior management review the information provided to students regarding the role of CCAs in university applications.  The conflicting advice given by students on the importance of portfolios versus GPAs, particularly in relation to competitive courses such as Law and Management, requires clarification.  A clearer communication strategy emphasizing the relative weight of academic performance versus extra-curricular activities would benefit students and reduce potential anxieties regarding university applications.  Moreover, review the information about the SEAL points system and how it is used in evaluating applications could ensure transparency and consistency in its application.
