The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student's inquiry regarding the penalty for late assignment submission.  The student asks whether the 10% deduction is applied to the maximum possible grade or to the student's actual achieved grade.  The comments offer conflicting answers, with some stating the penalty is applied to the maximum grade and others suggesting it's applied to the earned grade.  The consensus leans towards the deduction being from the maximum grade, but the users suggest checking official documentation for clarification.

The overall sentiment is one of uncertainty and mild anxiety regarding academic penalties. The student expresses concern about the late submission policy, while the commenters attempt to provide helpful information but also highlight the ambiguity surrounding the policy. The discussion focuses on the interpretation of the late submission policy, implicitly touching upon the clarity and accessibility of Temasek Polytechnic's assessment documentation and student handbook.  No specific facilities or aspects of the school beyond the academic assessment policy are mentioned.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Review the clarity of the late submission policy and its communication to students.  The conflicting interpretations in the Reddit thread suggest ambiguity in the policy's wording or its dissemination.  Consider revising the policy's language to eliminate any potential for misinterpretation, and ensure the student handbook and assessment documents clearly and unambiguously define the penalty calculation for late submissions.  This will reduce student anxiety and promote a fairer assessment process.
