The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of students enrolled in, or considering enrolling in, the Information Technology (IT) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Discussions revolve around the perceived difficulty of the curriculum, particularly in the first year (Y1),  the effectiveness of teaching methods, the adequacy of provided resources and support, and the overall preparedness of graduates for the industry.  Specific modules like COMT (Computer Programming), DSAG (Data Structures and Algorithms), ADEV (Advanced Development), DBAV (Database Administration), and NECT (Networking) are frequently mentioned in relation to these concerns.


The overall sentiment is mixed, ranging from positive to highly critical.  While some students express satisfaction with the hands-on learning opportunities, school facilities, and the overall quality of the program compared to other polytechnics, many express significant frustration with the curriculum's pace, teaching quality (including inconsistent marking standards and reliance on ChatGPT), insufficient support for projects (especially concerning ADEV/DBAV), and the perceived lack of clarity regarding self-directed learning expectations. Several comments highlight a mismatch between the taught curriculum and industry needs, with concerns about students lacking fundamental skills expected of junior developers after Y1.  The emotional tone shifts from initial anxiety and apprehension from the original poster to a blend of frustration, defense, and attempts to offer constructive feedback and advice among the commenters.  Mentions of specific facilities are positive, but the overall evaluation of management and teaching practices is less favorable.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address several key issues raised in the comments. Firstly, the inconsistent teaching styles and marking standards across different modules need urgent attention.  The perceived lack of support for certain modules, especially ADEV/DBAV, along with concerns about insufficient time allocated for projects, should be investigated. Secondly, a review of the Y1 curriculum is crucial. The comments suggest that the pace is too slow, leading to a disconnect between the skills learned and industry expectations. This should include a more explicit emphasis on self-directed learning and a closer alignment of the curriculum with industry needs, possibly through stronger partnerships with industry partners for syllabus revision.  Finally, exploring alternative teaching methods, beyond the perceived over-reliance on ChatGPT, and improving the clarity and detail of marking schemes, particularly in modules like NECT, are highly recommended.  The students' suggestion of readily available online resources should also be seriously considered and possibly integrated into the curriculum, as it would improve overall learning.
