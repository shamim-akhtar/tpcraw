The Reddit post and comments center on the discussion of unique and interesting Clubs and Societies (CCAs) at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster inquired about the "weirdest" CCA, prompting responses that identified the Japanese Club as having a reputation for unusual members and the newly introduced Stargazers club as unexpectedly unique.  The Business Studies club was also mentioned, with a commenter pointing out its presence in other academic schools within the polytechnic.

The overall sentiment is curious and lighthearted, with a generally positive tone.  While the Japanese Club is described as having "weird" members, this is presented more as an observation than a criticism. The mention of the Business Studies and Stargazers clubs is positive, with the latter's novelty being a point of interest.  There's no significant negative sentiment expressed regarding the school, its facilities, or any specific programs.  The conversation focuses solely on the diversity and perceived uniqueness of student activities.
