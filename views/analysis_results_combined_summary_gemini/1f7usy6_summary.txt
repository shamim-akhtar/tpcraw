The Reddit post and comments center around an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with a Temasek Polytechnic Law and Management graduate.  Discussions primarily revolve around the graduate's internship experience at a Big 4 accounting firm, the difficulty of securing Early Admission Exercise (EAE) to university, the overall career prospects of the course, and the academic rigor required for success.  Questions about the course's social aspects (number of attractive female students) and technological needs (laptop requirements) are also present.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While the graduate boasts a high GPA, their comments reveal a predominantly negative experience with the demanding and toxic work environment during their internship.  The tone is candid and occasionally humorous, using sarcastic remarks to highlight the stressful and unhealthy aspects of the chosen career path.  There's a strong emphasis on the intense pressure and high turnover rate within the internship, hinting at potential systemic issues.  No direct negative comments are made about Temasek Polytechnic itself, except for possibly inferring the difficulty of EAE based on the OP's own success.  The graduate's recommendations focus on the importance of hard work for academic success.

While no direct criticisms of Temasek Polytechnic are offered, the overwhelmingly negative portrayal of the internship environment raises concerns.  Senior management should review the career services provided to students, specifically the preparation and support offered for internships within demanding professional fields. This includes investigating the adequacy of counseling and support systems for students encountering toxic work environments.  Further, the comments about the intensity of the internship (high turnover, long hours, unhealthy lifestyle of partners)  suggest a need for greater emphasis in career counseling on navigating such professional environments and identifying potentially harmful workplaces.
