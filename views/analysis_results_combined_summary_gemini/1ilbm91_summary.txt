The Reddit post and comments center on the competitiveness of Club and Co-curricular Activities (CCAs), specifically sports CCAs like table tennis and badminton, at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster expresses concern about the selection process and the need for prior experience to gain entry.  Commenters confirm the highly competitive nature of these CCAs and detail the rigorous trial processes involved, sometimes including multiple rounds and a probationary period.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and apprehension from the original poster, who is worried about their chances of joining a desired sports CCA due to a lack of prior experience.  Commenters range from helpful, offering realistic advice about the selection process and the need for prior experience, to somewhat discouraging and even sarcastic.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities, although the discussion implicitly references the existence of sports CCAs and their associated training resources.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The high level of competitiveness and the perceived difficulty in joining sports CCAs, particularly for students without prior experience, should be reviewed.  Transparency about the selection criteria and processes for sports CCAs could be improved.  Consideration should be given to offering introductory or beginner-level programs within sports CCAs to provide opportunities for students with less experience to develop their skills and participate.  This could help foster inclusivity and broader participation in sports at the polytechnic.
