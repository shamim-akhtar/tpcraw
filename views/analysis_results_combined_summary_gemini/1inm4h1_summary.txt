The Reddit post and comments primarily center on the curriculum of the Computing and Programming for Problem Solving course within Temasek Polytechnic's School of Engineering.  Specifically, the discussion focuses on the programming language used (Python), the assessment breakdown (including online tests, practical tests, a written test, a large project, and class participation), and the format of the written test, which involves debugging code and writing code based on given instructions.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful.  Commenters readily share information about the course structure and assessment methods, creating a supportive environment for the original poster.  The specific mention of Python as the programming language is neutral, while the description of the assessment components is factual and informative.  There's no negative feedback regarding the school, its facilities, or its teaching staff.  The focus is entirely on the specifics of the course.

No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted based on this limited discussion. The post and comments relate to a single course's assessment structure, which appears clearly communicated and understood within the student community.
