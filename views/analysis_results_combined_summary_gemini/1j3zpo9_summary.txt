The Reddit post and comments center around the programming language taught in the first year of the common engineering program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster inquires about the specific language and necessary compiler.  Comments confirm that Python is the language used, with one commenter expressing negative sentiment towards the associated project.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While the initial response is helpful and reassuring, providing the answer to the poster's question, a subsequent comment expresses dissatisfaction with the project's quality.  The emotional tone ranges from anxious (the original poster's use of praying emojis) to mildly negative ("the project sucks"). There is no direct mention of specific school facilities beyond the implication of using computer labs or personal computers for coding projects.

Based on the limited information, I recommend senior management at Temasek Polytechnic review student feedback regarding the Year 1 common engineering programming project.  The negative comment suggests potential areas for improvement in the project design, instruction, or assessment methods.  Further investigation into student experiences with the project could reveal valuable insights for enhancing the learning experience and ensuring student engagement.
