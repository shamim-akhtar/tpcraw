The Reddit post and comments center on the question of how much class participation contributes to the final grade at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students are unsure about the exact weighting of participation, with some speculating it's a low percentage (2-3% or 4-7% depending on the module's total weighting), while others suggest it's difficult to gauge lecturer assessment.  There is also discussion about strategies for improving participation marks, including consistent attendance, active participation in tutorials and practicals, and directly asking lecturers for feedback (though the reliability of this approach is questioned).

The overall sentiment is one of uncertainty and anxiety. Students express concern about the lack of transparency regarding the weighting of class participation and the difficulty in assessing their own performance in this area.  There's a humorous undertone in some comments, such as the question about whether students even attend class. The school's assessment methods, specifically regarding class participation, are the primary subject of concern.  No specific facilities are mentioned.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Increase transparency regarding the grading criteria for class participation across different modules. Provide clear guidelines to lecturers on how to assess and communicate class participation scores to students. This could involve standardized rubrics or feedback mechanisms to alleviate student anxiety and provide better insight into their academic performance.  Consider incorporating more frequent and formal feedback methods, such as providing students with mid-semester estimates of their class participation scores.  This will reduce uncertainty and allow students to better plan their studies, particularly as it pertains to achieving scholarships or bursaries, as mentioned by one commenter.
