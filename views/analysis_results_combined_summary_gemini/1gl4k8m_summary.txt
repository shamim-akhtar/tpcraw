The Reddit post and its comments center around a student's request for help completing a survey for a school project.  The survey focuses on canteen preferences at Temasek Polytechnic, a topic acknowledged as common among student projects.  The student offers to reciprocate by helping others with their surveys.

The overall sentiment is one of polite desperation and helpfulness. The author expresses significant pleading in their request for survey completion, using numerous emojis to emphasize their need for assistance.  The comments (which are absent from the provided text) are not available for sentiment analysis, however the post itself shows a degree of anxiety and a willingness to help others in return. There is no direct mention of specific school facilities beyond the canteens, and no negative sentiment toward the school itself is expressed.

Given the lack of comments, no specific recommendations for senior management can be made. However, the repeated mention of canteen preference surveys suggests that perhaps a more centralized or streamlined method for collecting student feedback on canteen services could be explored.  This might alleviate the burden on individual students who repeatedly undertake similar projects.  A suggestion box or regularly scheduled feedback mechanisms could be implemented to improve efficiency and reduce student workload.
