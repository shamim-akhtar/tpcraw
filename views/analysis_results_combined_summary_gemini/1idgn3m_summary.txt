The Reddit post and comments center on a student's confusion regarding the "NECT" assignment, likely a networking project at Temasek Polytechnic.  The student is unclear about how to proceed without detailed company information, specifically regarding company size, network type (wired, wireless, or both), and the scope of customization allowed for the project.  Comments offer advice suggesting collaboration with groupmates to determine company size and confirming that the network security portion focuses on wireless networks.  One commenter suggests using YouTube tutorials and Packet Tracer software for assistance.


The overall sentiment is one of student confusion and seeking help.  While there's frustration about the lack of clear instructions in the assignment, the tone is generally positive and collaborative, with fellow students readily offering assistance and suggestions. There is no direct criticism of the school, its lecturers, or its facilities.  The discussion is focused solely on the NECT assignment itself and the challenges students face completing it.


Recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic:  The ambiguity surrounding the NECT assignment, particularly concerning the provision of company details and the specifics of the network security component, should be addressed.  Consider providing clearer guidelines and more comprehensive instructions in the assignment brief to avoid similar confusion amongst future students.  Greater clarity regarding the acceptable scope of customization for aspects like company size and business type will also improve the student experience.  Finally, exploring the integration of more comprehensive tutorials or example projects within the course material could offer additional support and reduce reliance on external resources like YouTube.
