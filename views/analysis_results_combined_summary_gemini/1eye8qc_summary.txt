The Reddit post and comments center on the grading policy for tutorials in the Applied Science Centre (ASC) at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main question is whether these tutorials contribute to the final grade, with comments clarifying that while not directly graded, attendance and participation in ASC tutorials impact the overall class participation mark.

The overall sentiment is one of mild concern and uncertainty regarding the tutorial grading system.  The original poster expresses a lack of attendance, indicating potential worry about academic standing. The comments offer clarification, shifting the tone to more reassurance, explaining the indirect impact of tutorial attendance on participation marks. No specific negative sentiment towards the school, its facilities (ASC specifically), or its instructors is expressed. The focus is primarily on the assessment criteria of a specific course element.


Given the student's apparent lack of attendance and the comments clarifying the impact of tutorials on participation grades, it's recommended that Temasek Polytechnic review the communication surrounding the ASC tutorial grading policy.  Clearer information provided directly to students, possibly in the course syllabus or through announcements, should explicitly state that while not directly graded, attendance and participation in ASC tutorials contribute to the class participation component of the final grade. This would reduce student anxiety and ensure clearer expectations from the start of the academic term.
