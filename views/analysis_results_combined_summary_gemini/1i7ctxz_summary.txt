The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the availability of makeup classes at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) for a student taking a Leave of Absence (LOA) for a week due to an overseas football competition.  The student is concerned about missing lessons and whether the school provides makeup classes for LOA periods.  The comments largely indicate that makeup classes are unlikely to be provided, but suggest alternative solutions like consulting with tutors, reviewing materials on the POLITEMall learning management system (LMS), and utilizing any available MS Teams recordings of lectures.  The validity of the LOA based on the reason for absence is also questioned.

The overall sentiment is largely negative regarding the likelihood of obtaining makeup classes.  While the comments are informative and provide practical suggestions, the tone is somewhat pessimistic and realistic. There is a sense of resignation that missing classes will require self-reliance in catching up on missed materials.  Positive aspects are that many lecturers are willing to help students individually if time permits, and that resources like POLITEMall and MS Teams recordings exist, even if they are not always consistently available across all departments.  The student's specific concerns relate to the availability of these resources and the general school policy regarding LOAs for non-academic reasons.

Based on the concerns expressed, I recommend the following for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:

* **Review LOA policy:** Evaluate the current LOA policy concerning student absences for extracurricular activities, particularly those representing national competitions. The comments highlight inconsistencies in approval, implying a need for clearer guidelines. A standardized process with clear criteria could ensure fairness.
* **Improve LMS accessibility and consistency:** While POLITEMall and MS Teams recordings are mentioned, their availability and reliability seem inconsistent across schools and departments.  Ensuring all departments provide comprehensive, readily accessible online materials could mitigate the impact of missed classes for various reasons, including LOAs.  This would directly address the students concerns and improve the overall learning experience.
* **Encourage consistent lecture recording:**  The inconsistent availability of recorded lectures on MS Teams suggests that a policy mandating consistent recording should be implemented.  This would provide students a valuable resource in case of absence for any reason.
