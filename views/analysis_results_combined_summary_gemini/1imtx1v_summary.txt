The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the competitiveness and commitment level of joining the Tchoukball CCA (Co-Curricular Activity) for girls at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The author expresses interest but lacks prior experience, also questioning the absence of a girls' handball CCA.  Comments highlight the generally high commitment required for all TP sports CCAs, emphasizing the need for dedication and competitive trials, while also suggesting that the TP sports club may be a more accessible option for beginners.


The overall sentiment is a mix of apprehension and hope.  The author expresses uncertainty about their chances due to a lack of experience.  Comments offer both realistic expectations of the high commitment and competitive nature of TP sports CCAs, particularly mentioning long training hours (6 pm to 11 pm), but also encourage trying out. The absence of a girls' handball CCA is noted with disappointment. While the comments acknowledge the challenges, they maintain a generally positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the rewarding nature of participation. There is no direct criticism of the school, its facilities, or specific instructors.


Recommendations for senior management:  The absence of a girls' handball CCA, noted with disappointment by the original poster, might warrant investigation.  Senior management could consider surveying student interest in various sports to better align CCA offerings with student demand and ensure equitable opportunities for all genders.  Additionally, while the long training hours (6 pm to 11 pm) are mentioned as typical,  exploring options to potentially adjust training schedules to better accommodate student workloads and well-being could improve participation and student satisfaction.
