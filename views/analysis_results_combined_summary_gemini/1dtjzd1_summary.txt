The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss food options available to students at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster seeks recommendations beyond the existing business and engineering canteens and fast-food establishments.  Commenters suggest various eateries both on and off campus, including specific restaurants like Soi Thai Kitchen, Hundred Acre, and several unnamed hotpot and Izakaya restaurants, along with general areas such as the market opposite TP.  Different cuisines, including Thai, Western, Japanese, and local options like Nasi Padang and chicken rice, are mentioned.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful, with a predominantly friendly and informative tone.  Commenters share their personal experiences and recommendations, offering a variety of suggestions to address the original poster's desire for culinary variety.  While some comments jokingly mention negative experiences (e.g., the strong effects of Nasi Padang), the overall tone remains lighthearted.  Specific mentions of TP facilities include the business and engineering canteens, and the IT school canteen. The external locations mentioned are viewed favorably, with emphasis on their quality and value (even if slightly more expensive) compared to in-campus options.

While no major concerns are raised, a recommendation for senior management at TP could be to conduct a survey of student preferences regarding on-campus food options.  This would help identify areas for improvement in the variety and quality of food served within the school canteens, potentially leading to increased student satisfaction and a reduction in the need to rely heavily on off-campus eateries.  Gathering feedback could focus on the pricing and availability of healthy and diverse food options to better meet the needs of the student body.
