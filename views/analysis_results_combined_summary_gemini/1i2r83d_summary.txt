The Reddit post and comments center on the availability and location of shower facilities within Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster inquires about the existence of showers, their cleanliness, and necessary amenities like slippers.  Commenters provide information on shower locations near the ISH (presumably an abbreviation for a building or department) and the swimming pool, advising users to bring their own towels.

The overall sentiment is inquisitive and slightly anxious. The original poster expresses uncertainty and concern about hygiene and necessary items.  The comments are helpful and informative, providing practical advice. There's no overwhelmingly negative or positive sentiment towards the school or its facilities; instead, the focus is on the practical matter of locating and using available showers. The mention of needing to bring one's own towel subtly suggests a possible lack of readily available amenities within the shower facilities.

Based on the comments, a recommendation for senior management at TP would be to improve signage indicating the location of shower facilities.  Clarifying the availability of towels or other amenities within the showers near the ISH and the swimming pool would also be beneficial.  This would address the implicit concern about preparedness and potentially improve the overall student experience.  A simple, updated map including the shower locations on the TP website or campus maps could proactively address user queries and improve wayfinding.
