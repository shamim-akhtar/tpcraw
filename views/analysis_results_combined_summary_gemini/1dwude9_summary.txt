The Reddit post and its comments center on the upcoming aptitude test and interview for the Communication and Media Management (CMM) course (T40) at Temasek Polytechnic's EAE (Early Admission Exercise) in 2024.  The author expresses significant anxiety and seeks advice from senior students regarding the test format, question types, interview style (one-on-one or group), and examples of successful e-portfolios.  The comments, while not provided, would presumably offer this requested guidance.


The overall sentiment is one of high anxiety and uncertainty. The author explicitly expresses nervousness about the upcoming aptitude test and interview.  The emotional tone is pleading and hopeful, seeking reassurance and practical assistance from the community.  Mentions of Temasek Polytechnic are implicitly positive, as the author is actively pursuing admission, and the reference to the CMM course suggests a positive perception of the program.  However, the lack of specific comments prevents a complete assessment of sentiment towards specific facilities or aspects of the school.


Without access to the comment content, concrete recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are impossible.  However, if the comments reveal consistent concerns about the clarity of the aptitude test information or the interview process,  management should consider reviewing the information provided to prospective students.  Improving pre-admission communication, offering more detailed sample questions and portfolio examples, and possibly providing preparation resources could alleviate student anxiety and improve the overall candidate experience.  This would specifically address the concerns expressed in the post regarding the lack of information about the aptitude test and interview process.
