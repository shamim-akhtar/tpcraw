The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) aerospace engineering student's concern about computer compatibility. The student purchased a MacBook Pro believing it met the program's requirements, only to discover it's now listed as "not recommended."  The discussion focuses on whether the lecturer will enforce the use of a Windows laptop, the minimum specifications needed for the course, and potential workarounds such as using Parallels or school lab computers.


The overall sentiment is a mixture of anxiety and uncertainty. The original poster expresses concern about a potentially wasted investment.  Other commenters offer reassuring advice, suggesting workarounds and emphasizing that lecturers primarily care about functionality, not the specific operating system.  The discussion highlights the importance of clear and up-to-date  computer requirements communicated by the school to prospective and current students.  The mention of 3D modeling and simulations as software requiring higher specifications suggests a concern about the school's equipment and software support.


It is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review its communication of computer requirements for the Aerospace Engineering program.  Specifically, the inconsistency between last year's and this year's specifications concerning MacBooks should be addressed.  Furthermore, clarifying whether the "not recommended" status implies functional limitations or simply a preference for Windows-based systems is crucial.  Finally, proactively providing a comprehensive list of compatible software and minimum system requirements, along with information regarding available resources like school lab computers, would alleviate student concerns and improve transparency.
