The Reddit post is a request for help completing a survey for a school project by a Temasek Polytechnic student.  The post itself provides only a link to the Google Form survey and a plea for assistance, offering "10 years of good luck" as an incentive.  There are no comments provided within the given data.  Therefore, no specific issues related to Temasek Polytechnic are discussed.


The overall sentiment is one of desperation and pleading, stemming from the author's concern about failing their project. The emotional tone is anxious and slightly manipulative, attempting to incentivize responses through the promise of good luck.  No specific mentions of the school's subjects, facilities, or other aspects are present in either the post or the (missing) comments.


Given the lack of comments and discussion about Temasek Polytechnic itself, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for senior management based on this Reddit post.  The post solely focuses on a student's need for survey completion and doesn't offer any insights into the institution's operations or student experience.
