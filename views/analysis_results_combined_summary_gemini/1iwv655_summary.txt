The Reddit post and comments center on the challenges faced by first-year students in the Information Technology (IIT) diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), specifically the perceived difficulty of the curriculum.  A group of students created a Discord server to offer peer support and assistance with coursework and assignments.  The comments also discuss the overall learning environment, lecturer support, student responsibility, and the provision of internships.  A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the role of student effort versus the institution's responsibilities in academic success.


The overall sentiment is mixed. While there's appreciation for the initiative to create a supportive Discord community and acknowledgment of lecturers who go the extra mile, a significant undercurrent of frustration and criticism exists regarding the perceived lack of support from the school, particularly concerning the handling of internships.  Some comments express cynicism towards students who lack initiative, while others highlight concerns about the difficulty of the IIT curriculum and the lack of readily available resources in the first year.  Specific mentions include inadequate support for struggling students, unclear marking rubrics, and the school's failure to secure internships as promised.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address several concerns raised in the comments.  First, investigate the claims regarding unclear marking rubrics in the IIT program and take steps to improve clarity and transparency in assessment criteria. Second, review the internship placement process for third-year students, as the failure to provide promised internships, as claimed by students, needs investigation and rectification.  Finally, while acknowledging the responsibility of students in their academic success, explore ways to improve support systems, especially for first-year students, potentially through improved orientation programs, additional tutoring resources, and clearer communication channels regarding available support services.  Consider if the curriculum difficulty of the IIT program aligns with student preparedness and support structures.
