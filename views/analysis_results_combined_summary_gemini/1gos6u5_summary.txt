The Reddit post and comments center on a final-year Temasek Polytechnic business school student's frustration with uncooperative group members during their Final Year Project (FYP). The student describes taking on the majority of the workload while other group members are unresponsive and fail to contribute meaningfully.  The discussion focuses on whether or not the student should report this "freeloading" behavior to their lecturer and the potential consequences of doing so.

The overall sentiment is one of support for the student reporting the issue. While acknowledging the realities of encountering uncooperative colleagues in the workplace, commenters overwhelmingly advise the student to report the problem to their lecturer.  There is a slightly anxious tone regarding potential repercussions, such as potential ostracization, but the prevailing emotion is one of urging the student to address the unfair workload distribution. No specific comments were made about the school, its facilities, or lecturers beyond the context of the FYP and its supervision.

While no specific concerns about Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or overall school management are raised, a recommendation for senior management would be to review and potentially improve the group project assignment process within the Business School.  This could involve clearer guidelines for group formation, more robust mechanisms for addressing intra-group conflict, and perhaps more structured progress checks to prevent situations where one student carries the majority of the workload.  The current system appears to leave students vulnerable to unfair group dynamics, negatively impacting their FYP experience and potentially their final grades.
