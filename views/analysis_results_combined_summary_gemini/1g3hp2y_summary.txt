Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Investigate the reported removal of the microwave from Engineering Block 10 and address the apparent shortage of microwaves in the Engineering block.  Consider installing additional microwaves in this area to better cater to student needs.  Clearer signage indicating the location of all available microwaves across campus could also improve student experience.  The discrepancy in the number and location of available microwaves also highlights a potential communication gap; ensuring consistent information is provided regarding facilities and amenities should be prioritized.
