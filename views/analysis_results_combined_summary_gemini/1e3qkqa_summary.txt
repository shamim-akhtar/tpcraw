The Reddit post and its comments center on a request for participants in a psychology study being conducted by students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The study, expected to last a maximum of 30 minutes, is taking place in the TP library.  A key aspect of the discussion is clarifying the date and time of the study, with initial confusion regarding the day.

The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly positive.  The poster expresses enthusiasm for the study and offers an incentive ("goodies") for participation. The commenter's inquiry reflects a genuine interest in participating, demonstrating a positive engagement with the student's request. No negative sentiments are expressed towards Temasek Polytechnic, its facilities (specifically the library is mentioned as the location), or any other aspects of the school.

No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted based on this post and its comments.  The exchange is solely focused on participant recruitment for a student-led research project and doesn't reflect any broader issues within the institution.
