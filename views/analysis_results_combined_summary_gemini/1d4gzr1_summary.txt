The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss whether Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) TPFun subjects (specifically "ecomms" and "procomm") contribute to the Grade Point Average (GPA).  The central question revolves around whether these subjects, which carry credit units, impact GPA calculations, with varying opinions expressed among commenters.

The overall sentiment is a mix of uncertainty and slight negativity.  While some commenters believe certain TPFun subjects are graded and contribute to GPA, others express that some are essentially pass/fail, deeming them a "waste of time" despite being necessary for progression.  There's a lack of definitive consensus, leading to apprehension about the subject's impact on academic standing.  Specific subjects like "ecomms" and "procomm" are named, but no direct criticisms of the school's facilities or general learning environment are expressed.

Based on the comments, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the clarity of information regarding the impact of TPFun subjects on student GPAs.  The conflicting information and confusion surrounding whether certain TPFun subjects are graded or pass/fail suggests a need to improve communication to students.  A clearer explanation in the school handbook or through other official channels could alleviate student anxieties and ensure a more transparent academic assessment system regarding TPFun's contribution to GPA.
