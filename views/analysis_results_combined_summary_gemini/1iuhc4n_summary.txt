The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the possibility of failing the CICT (likely a course or module) at Temasek Polytechnic.  The conversation centers on the difficulty of failing the course, with multiple commenters stating it requires significant effort to do so.  However, several anecdotes describe instances where students did indeed fail, often due to neglecting assignments or poor attendance. The consequences of failing CICT, such as ineligibility for merit or the Director's List, are also discussed.

The overall sentiment is initially one of disbelief and humor regarding the possibility of failing CICT, quickly shifting to a more concerned and helpful tone as users share their experiences and offer advice.  While some comments are lighthearted ("don't be a clown"), others express genuine worry and concern for the original poster.  The mentions of CICT itself are generally neutral, but there's an implied understanding that it's not a particularly demanding course, requiring only minimal effort to pass.  No specific facilities are mentioned.

Based on the discussion, I recommend Temasek Polytechnic senior management review the CICT curriculum and assessment methods. The fact that students have failed, albeit rarely, suggests a need for clearer instructions and support for students struggling with assignments.  While the course's non-graded nature might seem beneficial, the anecdotal evidence suggests some students may be misinterpreting “minimal effort” and neglecting essential tasks leading to failure.  A review of the course design, particularly the assignment instructions and marking rubrics, could improve student understanding and reduce failure rates.  Finally, proactive measures to improve student attendance could also be beneficial.
