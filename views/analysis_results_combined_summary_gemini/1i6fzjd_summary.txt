The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the Accountancy and Finance (A&F) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Key topics include the difficulty of the curriculum, particularly the significant jump in difficulty from Year 1 to Year 2, the specialization choices in Year 3 (auditing or investment), the workload and exam-heavy nature of the course, and the overall student experience, including social dynamics and stereotypes associated with A&F students.  Several commenters shared their GPAs and offered advice to prospective students.


The overall sentiment is mixed. While some commenters express positive experiences, highlighting the possibility of achieving high GPAs with consistent effort and praising the support offered by tutorials, many describe the program as challenging and stressful, particularly the transition to Year 2.  Negative comments focus on the perceived difficulty of certain modules (like Advanced Accounting), the high volume of exams and assessments, and the social dynamics within the A&F cohort.  The stereotype of A&F students struggling with balancing debits and credits is frequently mentioned and confirmed as largely true.  Some comments suggest a significant proportion of A&F students are perceived as being overly preoccupied with social media and popularity. There's no direct criticism leveled at the school's facilities, but comments highlight a perceived lack of preparation for the drastic difficulty increase from Year 1 to Year 2.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management: The significant discrepancy in difficulty between Year 1 and Year 2 of the A&F program is a major concern raised by multiple students.  A smoother transition needs to be implemented to better support students.  The curriculum's heavy reliance on exams might be overly stressful and could benefit from a review to incorporate more diverse assessment methods.  Finally, the comments highlighting the perceived immaturity and social media focus of a segment of the student body might warrant a review of student support systems and/or social initiatives to foster a more balanced and productive learning environment.
