A comment expresses similar uncertainty and a reliance on social media for updates.

The overall sentiment is one of mild anxiety and uncertainty.  The original poster expresses a concern about the delay in receiving the enrolment email, reflecting a degree of stress related to the application process. The commenter echoes this uncertainty and highlights the lack of official information, suggesting a potential communication gap.

Recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic would be to improve proactive communication regarding the enrolment process.  The lack of clear information and the reliance on social media for updates suggests a need for more transparent and timely communication to prospective students.  A dedicated, easily accessible webpage or email chain specifically addressing enrolment updates could alleviate anxiety and improve the student experience.  Furthermore, a more precise timeline for sending out enrolment emails should be established and communicated clearly.
