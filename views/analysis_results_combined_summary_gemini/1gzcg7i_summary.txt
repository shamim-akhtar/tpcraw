The Reddit post discusses a model casting advertisement found in Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) IIT school block.  The author is unsure whether to attend due to the size requirements (XS-S), the request for heels, and the need for form-fitting clothing.  Comments range from advising against attending due to potential impropriety to encouraging the author to try.  One commenter reveals the flyer originated from ADM (Art, Design, and Media) students.

The overall sentiment is a mixture of skepticism and amusement.  The author expresses uncertainty and self-consciousness about their body type and lack of resources. Commenters express concern about the appropriateness of the advertisement's placement in an academic building (IIT block, specifically), questioning its legitimacy and suggesting it's "sus."  One commenter is dismissive of the concerns and advocates for trying.  The mention of IIT block and the ADM students' involvement raises questions about the school's oversight of advertising on its premises.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the appropriateness of allowing potentially exploitative advertisements, targeting students, on campus.  Specifically, the advertisement's location within the IIT block, its size requirements, and the request for heels and form-fitting clothing raise concerns about potential body image issues and the potential for exploitation of students.  Review of advertising policies and procedures, and the involvement of the ADM students in this activity warrant investigation to prevent similar incidents in the future.  A clearer guideline on what constitutes appropriate advertising on campus, especially targeting students, should be established and enforced.
