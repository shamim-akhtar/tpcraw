The Reddit post is from a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student advertising an IT consultant job related to a legal case.  The job requires expertise in data synchronization across mobile devices and IP address tracing from email headers, targeting individuals with IT backgrounds, ideally at the Diploma level or higher.  The only comment expresses skepticism ("Skem," implying a scam).

The overall sentiment is highly uncertain and leans towards negative due to the single comment expressing suspicion of a scam.  There is no direct mention of TP's school facilities or subjects, except for the fact that the poster is a student there, implying no direct assessment of the school itself. The job description itself doesn't evoke any particular emotion but presents a professional opportunity.

Considering the single comment expressing suspicion, a recommendation for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic would be to remind students of the importance of verifying job opportunities before engaging, perhaps through resources or workshops that educate students on recognizing and avoiding scams.  This is particularly relevant given that the student is advertising the opportunity on a TP-related subreddit, implying a potential risk to the TP community's reputation if the job posting turns out to be fraudulent.
