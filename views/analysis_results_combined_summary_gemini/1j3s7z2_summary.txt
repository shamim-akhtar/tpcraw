The Reddit post and comments center on questions from a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student about the Personal Financial Planning (PFP) program.  The main concerns revolve around the typical schedule, the feasibility of working while studying, and the overall workload and difficulty of the PFP course.  Students offer diverse perspectives on the program's intensity, highlighting the importance of consistent effort despite the absence of a GPA.  The role and demands of the PFP Ambassadors CCA are also briefly discussed.

The overall sentiment is a mix of helpfulness and realism.  While some comments describe the schedule as relatively relaxed and manageable, particularly compared to Year 1, others emphasize the importance of diligence to avoid potential expulsion for failing modules. The tone is generally positive and supportive, with several users offering detailed information about the typical class timings and providing practical advice on balancing work and studies, specifically suggesting leveraging flex weeks and vacation periods.  There is no negative commentary directed specifically at the school, its facilities, or its staff.  The mention of the PFP Ambassadors CCA provides a slightly more demanding context, suggesting additional time commitment beyond regular classes.


Recommendations for senior management are not explicitly warranted based solely on this thread. The students' comments provide valuable insights into the student experience, but do not highlight systemic issues needing immediate attention.  However, maintaining open communication channels and providing accurate and updated information regarding program expectations and balancing work and studies, particularly for programs such as PFP,  would be beneficial.  Further, proactively clarifying expectations regarding extracurricular activities such as the PFP Ambassadors CCA could alleviate any potential anxieties amongst students.
