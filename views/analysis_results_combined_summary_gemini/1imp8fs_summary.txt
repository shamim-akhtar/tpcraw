The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the grading system for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) "TPFun" modules, specifically focusing on which modules are graded (affecting GPA) versus pass/fail.  The main modules identified as graded are E-commerce (ECOMM), Professional Communication (PROCOMM), and Global Studies (GS), with varying experiences reported regarding Innovation and Entrepreneurship (INNOVA).  Some commenters note changes to the grading system over time, with a trend towards fewer graded modules.

The overall sentiment is a mix of frustration and relief. While some students found graded modules like INNOVA and GS to be a significant time commitment and stressful, others express contentment with the shift toward a predominantly pass/fail system, viewing it as allowing them to focus on core subjects. The emotional tone ranges from mildly negative (describing INNOVA as a "nightmare") to positive (welcoming the change in grading), with a recurring theme of uncertainty regarding the grading structure and its changes across different semesters and courses. The comments regarding the Global Studies module reveal a dissatisfaction with the cancellation of an overseas trip, but also highlight the flexibility afforded in the final assignment.  There's no explicit mention of school facilities.

**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

Clarify the current grading system for TPFun modules across all courses.  The inconsistency reported in the comments highlights a need for clearer communication and consistent application of grading policies.  Regular updates to students about changes in the TPFun module grading system are recommended.  Additionally, the negative experiences shared regarding the INNOVA module warrant a review of its structure and assessment methods to alleviate student stress and improve the learning experience.  Finally, a review of the Global Studies module's overseas trip cancellation process and communication with students is recommended.  Transparent and consistent communication about the justification for cancellations and alternative arrangements would improve student satisfaction.
