The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the grading system for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Foundation Programme modules, specifically focusing on which modules are graded (affecting GPA) versus pass/fail.  The main points of contention are the grading of "E-commerce" (ECOMM), "Professional Communication" (PROCOMM), "Innovation and Entrepreneurship" (INNOVA), and "Global Studies" (GS).  There's debate regarding past grading practices and the current system's fairness and workload.  The impact of the INNOVA module's collaboration with the National University Hospital (NUH) is also mentioned.


The overall sentiment is a mix of frustration and relief.  Students express negative feelings towards the perceived excessive workload and difficulty of the INNOVA module, with some calling it a "nightmare" and a "waste of time."  The grading of GS is also a source of discussion, with past experiences varying from a graded video presentation and essay to a simple pass/fail.  There is a sense of relief among some students about recent changes simplifying the GS assessment, allowing them to focus on core subjects. The mention of TP facilities is absent, but the experience of a cancelled trip as part of the GS module highlights a logistical aspect that impacted students' learning.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Review the grading system and workload of the INNOVA module. The recurring negative feedback suggests a need for curriculum adjustments, potentially reducing workload or re-evaluating the assessment methods to improve student experience and reduce perceived unfairness.  Consider student feedback on the GS moduleâ€™s logistical challenges and ensure clarity in communication regarding assessment methods, especially considering the international trip component.   Investigate the inconsistency in GS grading across different cohorts and strive for standardized assessment methods to ensure fairness and transparency. Finally, ensure that any changes to the program are communicated clearly to students to avoid confusion and anxiety.
