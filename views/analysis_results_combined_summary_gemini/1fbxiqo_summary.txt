The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student, IndependentNo6105, who failed their Data Analytics and Visualization (DAVA) assignment in the Integrated Information Technology (IIT) course.  The student is seeking advice on their options, primarily focusing on whether to transfer to a pharmaceutical course or retake the IIT course.  Discussions also revolve around the implications of Early Admission Exercise (EAE) admission, the possibility of course transfers within TP, and the impact of late assignment submissions on the final grade.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and frustration. The student expresses significant concern about their academic performance and future prospects.  Comments range from supportive and offering advice to questioning the student's actions (e.g., inquiring about assignment submission).  There is a clear sense of stress surrounding the Dava assignment and the consequences of failing. The school's policies regarding course transfers and late submissions are discussed, with some uncertainty expressed about the details and fairness of these policies. No specific facilities are mentioned, but the discussion implicitly highlights the academic pressures and perceived limitations within the IIT course structure at TP.


**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

The situation highlights potential areas for improvement.  The lack of clarity regarding late submission penalties and their impact on grades causes significant student anxiety.  Senior management at TP should review the clarity and fairness of the late submission policy for the IIT course, ensuring transparent communication to students about the consequences.  Additionally, the perceived difficulty of the DAVA module within the IIT course should be reviewed.  A studentâ€™s comment suggests that the subject itself presents challenges to some students, warranting exploration of potential curriculum improvements, such as additional support resources or adjustments to the assignment weighting.  Finally,  exploring more flexible course transfer options within TP for students facing unforeseen academic challenges could be beneficial, possibly by providing more clearly defined pathways for students with EAE admission.
