The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss internship opportunities for Diploma in Accountancy and Finance students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main issue revolves around conflicting information regarding the internship application process: whether students are solely reliant on a school-provided list of companies or if they can independently secure internships with prior school approval.  The post seeks advice on internship search websites, but the comments suggest the process is primarily managed by the polytechnic.


The overall sentiment is one of confusion and uncertainty regarding the internship process. The original poster expresses anxiety about finding an internship, highlighting the need for guidance.  The comments reveal a discrepancy in information, with one commenter suggesting a school-mandated list of companies, and the original poster contradicting this by mentioning their course head's encouragement of self-secured internships (requiring school approval).  There is no explicit mention of specific school facilities or subjects beyond the Diploma in Accountancy and Finance program itself. The emotional tone is anxious and slightly frustrated due to the conflicting advice received.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Clarify the internship application process for Diploma in Accountancy and Finance students.  The conflicting information provided by the course head and a previous student indicates a need for updated and consistent communication regarding internship procedures. This might involve disseminating a clear, centralized policy document outlining student options (school-provided list vs. self-sourced internships) and the approval process.  Improved communication will reduce student anxiety and ensure a smoother internship search for future students.
