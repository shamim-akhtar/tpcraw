The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the process of securing internships for Diploma in Accountancy and Finance students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main issue revolves around conflicting information regarding the internship application process:  whether students are solely reliant on a school-provided list of companies or if they can independently secure internships with prior school approval.  Discrepancies exist between the advice given by the course head and the experiences of previous students.

The overall sentiment is one of confusion and uncertainty among students regarding the internship process.  The tone is slightly anxious, reflecting the stress of securing a crucial part of their education.  The student expresses hope for assistance. While the school itself isn't directly criticized, the conflicting information provided by the course head and previous students highlights a potential communication breakdown within the department.  No specific facilities are mentioned.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Clarify the internship application process for Accountancy and Finance students. The conflicting advice received by current students underscores a need for consistent and updated information disseminated to all students.  Consider creating a centralized, easily accessible resource (e.g., a dedicated webpage or intranet page) detailing the exact steps, timelines, and requirements for securing internships, including whether self-sourced internships are permitted and the approval process involved. This will alleviate student anxiety and ensure a smoother transition into the internship phase of their studies.
