The Reddit post focuses on a single, simple query: the password for a projector in an unspecified lecture theatre at Temasek Polytechnic.  The comments section is empty, offering no further discussion or elaboration on the topic.

The overall sentiment is neutral and inquisitive.  The post itself is light-hearted, indicated by the smiley face emoticon. However, due to the absence of comments, there is no broader sentiment regarding the lecture theatres, the school, or its facilities expressed by the community.  No specific subjects, facilities beyond the mention of a projector in a lecture theatre, or aspects of the school are discussed.

Given the lack of further discussion and the limited scope of the original post, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management. The issue is a minor, isolated technical question concerning projector access.
