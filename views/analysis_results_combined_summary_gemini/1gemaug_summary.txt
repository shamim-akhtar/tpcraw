The Reddit post and comments center on the difficulties students are experiencing with the facial recognition system at Temasek Polytechnic's library.  Users report inconsistent recognition despite minimal changes in appearance, requiring multiple attempts and adjustments like smiling or removing glasses to gain entry.  The core issue is the system's apparent inability to accurately identify students under varying conditions.

The overall sentiment is one of frustration and humor. While the initial post expresses anger and exasperation, the comments largely respond with lighthearted sarcasm and shared experiences.  The comments reveal a common problem with the library's facial recognition system, highlighting its inaccuracy and inconvenience for students.  The references to the matric card photo, weight changes, hairstyles, and facial expressions underscore the system's sensitivity to even minor variations in appearance.  There is no direct criticism of other school facilities or subjects.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Investigate and address the reported inaccuracies in the library's facial recognition system.  The system's frequent failures to recognize students, even with minimal changes in appearance, create significant inconvenience and frustration.  Consider implementing a more robust and tolerant system, or providing alternative access methods for students encountering persistent recognition issues.  Gathering feedback from students on potential improvements should also be prioritized.
