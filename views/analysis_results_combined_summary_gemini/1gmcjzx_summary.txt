The Reddit post is a simple request for survey completion regarding an unspecified project related to Temasek Polytechnic.  The post itself provides no further information beyond a link to the survey.  There are no comments provided, thus leaving the content of the survey and any potential issues or opinions undisclosed.

The overall sentiment is neutral.  The post itself is simply informational, requesting participation in a survey.  Without any comments, there is no discernible emotional tone or specific opinions expressed regarding the school, its facilities, or any particular subject.  The lack of comments prevents assessment of student or staff opinions.

Given the absence of comments and details about the survey's content, no specific concerns or recommendations can be offered to Temasek Polytechnic's senior management.  Further information is needed to analyze any potential issues arising from the survey.
