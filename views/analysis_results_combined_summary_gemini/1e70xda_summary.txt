The Reddit post discusses a student's concern about lacking achievements to mention during a Biomedical Science Early Admission Exercise (EAE) interview at Temasek Polytechnic.  The student is seeking advice on quickly building up their achievements within a two-week timeframe, and is already undertaking two online courses for certification.  The only comment expresses skepticism about the student's rush to obtain certificates.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty from the original poster.  The student expresses worry about their lack of accomplishments and seeks immediate solutions. The comment displays a slightly critical tone, questioning the value of hastily acquired certificates. There is no direct mention of specific school facilities or aspects of the Biomedical Science program itself in either the post or the comment.

Given the limited information, no specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted. However, the post highlights a potential area for improvement:  providing prospective students with clearer guidance on what constitutes strong achievements for EAE applications.  This could potentially reduce student anxiety and ensure a more equitable application process.
