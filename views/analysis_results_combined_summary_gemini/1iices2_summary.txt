The Reddit post and comments primarily revolve around a student, dhane5h, who was accepted into the Chemical Engineering course at Temasek Polytechnic and is seeking to connect with other students in the same program to make friends and exchange contact information.  A comment jokingly suggests the poster might struggle with the mathematics component of the course.


The overall sentiment is positive and welcoming.  The original poster expresses excitement and a desire for social connection. The comments offer supportive responses and well wishes.  There is no negative sentiment towards the school, its Chemical Engineering program, or its facilities; the subject of mathematics is only mentioned briefly and in jest.


There are no specific concerns or recommendations for senior management based on this limited interaction. The post and comments reflect a typical student experience of beginning a polytechnic program and seeking social connection, not highlighting any systemic issues within Temasek Polytechnic.
