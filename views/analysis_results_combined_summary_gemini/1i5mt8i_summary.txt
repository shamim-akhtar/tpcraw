The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the availability of mala (a spicy Chinese dish) at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Users inquire about its presence on campus and provide specific locations, namely within the School of Engineering and at ShortCircuit, a canteen in the first engineering building.  A comment expresses a subjective opinion on the spiciness level of the mala at ShortCircuit.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful.  The initial post expresses a simple inquiry, which is answered promptly and constructively by other users.  The tone is casual and friendly.  The discussion centers around the School of Engineering and its canteens, specifically mentioning ShortCircuit as a location offering mala. There is no negative sentiment towards the school or its facilities; rather, the focus is on the availability and quality of a specific food item.

While no serious concerns are raised, a minor recommendation for senior management at TP could be to gather student feedback on the quality and variety of food options available across campus.  Specifically,  the comment regarding the insufficient spiciness of the mala at ShortCircuit in the School of Engineering could be seen as an indicator that student preferences may not be fully met.  Gathering this feedback through surveys or online forums could help improve food services and student satisfaction.
