The Reddit post and comments center on a Year 3, Semester 2 (Y3S2) Fintech student at Temasek Polytechnic seeking assistance with a project.  The student specifically requires help utilizing KNIME software for data analysis and Axure RP 11 for design aspects of the assignment.  No comments are provided in the given data, thus limiting the discussion to the student's request for help.

The overall sentiment is one of stress and desperation.  The student clearly expresses a lack of understanding regarding the required software (KNIME and Axure RP 11) and urgently seeks help.  There's no direct mention of the school or its facilities beyond the contextual information provided by the student's course and year level.  The emotional tone is anxious and pleading, reflecting the student's struggle with the assignment.

Given the absence of comments, no specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management can be offered. However, the student's post highlights a potential gap in either the curriculum's preparation for using KNIME and Axure RP 11, or the availability of adequate support resources for students struggling with these software programs.  Further investigation into student experiences with the Fintech program's software training and support systems would be beneficial.
