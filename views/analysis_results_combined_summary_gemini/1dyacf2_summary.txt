The Reddit post and comments primarily concern the grading system at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Specifically, the original poster seeks information on the percentage required to achieve each letter grade (A, B+, B, etc.), while a commenter suggests checking the TP Online Student Portal System (TPOSS) and provides an estimate of the grading scale.

The overall sentiment is one of mild uncertainty and helpfulness.  The original poster expresses a need for information, exhibiting a neutral to slightly anxious tone. The commenter attempts to provide assistance, offering a possible solution (checking TPOSS) and a recollection of the grading percentages, though admitting uncertainty.  No specific negative sentiments regarding the school, its facilities, or any particular subject are expressed.  The commenter's estimation of the grading scale (80%+ for A, decreasing in 5% increments) does not express a negative opinion, but rather a helpful suggestion.

Based on the limited information, I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review the accessibility and clarity of grade percentage information available to students on the TPOSS.  Ensuring that this crucial information is readily available and easily understood would prevent students from needing to seek this information on external platforms like Reddit.  A clear, easily accessible explanation of the grading system on the student portal would improve student experience and reduce uncertainty.
