The Reddit post and comments primarily focus on the unsatisfactory physical environment of the Information and  Technology (IIT) building at Temasek Polytechnic.  Specific issues raised include the lack of seating outside classrooms, making it inconvenient for students arriving early or waiting for presentations; the bland and unappealing aesthetic of the building, described as resembling an abandoned factory; and the absence of a dedicated study area for IIT students, forcing them to rely on potentially noisy shared spaces or the main library.  The posters suggest student involvement in improving both the curriculum and the physical learning spaces.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration and disappointment with the IIT building's condition.  The emotional tone ranges from mildly critical to strongly negative, with comments using phrases like "abandoned factory," "mental hospital corridors," and "soulless AI prompts" to describe the building's visual appeal and atmosphere. The cold and small classroom size is also criticized. The lack of comfortable seating and a dedicated study space are seen as significant shortcomings impacting student experience.  The AI-generated artwork in public areas is viewed as unappealing and a poor substitute for student-created art.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the concerns regarding the IIT building's physical environment.  Specifically, they should consider: 1) Installing benches or tables and chairs outside classrooms in Block 3 and other blocks where feasible, to provide students with comfortable waiting areas; 2) Improving the visual appeal of the IIT building by commissioning student artwork or exploring more aesthetically pleasing design solutions, moving away from solely relying on AI-generated designs; and 3) Creating a dedicated, quiet study area specifically for IIT students, offering a more private and accessible alternative to the shared "Student Hub" or the main library.  Engaging students in the design and improvement process, both for the curriculum and the physical space, is strongly recommended.
