The Reddit post and comments center on criticisms of the Information Technology (IIT) department at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Specific complaints include inadequate preparation time for a 30% graded quiz in a subject called "NECT,"  poorly structured and rushed teaching methods in ADE/DBAV (likely referring to specific modules or courses), and the use of copied materials from Cisco in NECT, including quizzes with no feedback mechanism on incorrect answers.  A general sentiment of dissatisfaction with the department's organization and teaching practices is expressed.


The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and frustrated.  The emotional tone ranges from annoyed to angry, using strong language like "trash," "garbage," "lazy swine," and "fucking shocked."  The criticisms are directed at the IIT department's teaching methods, course structure (specifically NECT and ADE/DBAV), and the quality of learning materials, highlighting a perceived lack of effort and preparedness on the part of instructors.  The comments suggest the use of copied Cisco materials instead of creating original TP notes as a particular source of frustration.


**Recommendations for Senior Management:**  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic's IIT department should investigate the complaints regarding inadequate preparation time for assessments, particularly the NECT quiz.  A review of the ADE/DBAV course structure and teaching methodology is recommended to ensure efficient and effective knowledge transfer.  The use of copied Cisco materials in NECT and the lack of feedback on mock quizzes warrant immediate attention.  Developing original learning materials and providing comprehensive feedback mechanisms for assessments are crucial steps toward improving student learning experience.  Furthermore, exploring anonymous feedback mechanisms or channels (beyond Reddit) could provide valuable insight into student concerns.
