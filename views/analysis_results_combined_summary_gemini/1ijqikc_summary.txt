The Reddit post and comments center on the feasibility of gaining admission to Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) or Singapore Management University (SMU) law programs after completing Temasek Polytechnic's part-time Diploma in Legal Executive Studies. The primary concern is the competitiveness of the application process and the likelihood of success given the part-time nature of the diploma.  The comments suggest a low probability of acceptance unless the applicant possesses exceptional grades and a strong academic background from A-Levels or another diploma program.

The overall sentiment is one of skepticism and low expectation regarding admission to law school after completing the part-time diploma.  The comments express a realistic, almost pessimistic, view of the difficulty involved. There's no overtly negative sentiment towards Temasek Polytechnic itself,  but the focus is on the challenges of transitioning from the specific diploma to a highly competitive undergraduate law program. The discussion highlights the competitiveness of law school admissions, and the perceived disadvantage of undertaking the diploma part-time.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  While not directly criticizing the program, the discussion highlights the need for improved career guidance and clearer communication regarding the post-diploma pathways available to students.  Specifically, the Polytechnic should offer more realistic expectations for students considering further education in law following the completion of the part-time Diploma in Legal Executive Studies, possibly by providing statistics on the successful transition rates to programs such as SUSS and SMU Law.  The career counseling service should adequately prepare students for the competitive landscape of law school admissions and explore alternative career paths with similar outcomes.
