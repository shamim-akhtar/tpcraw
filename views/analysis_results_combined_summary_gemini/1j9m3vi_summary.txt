The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the compatibility of a MacBook Air M2 with the International Trade course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster is concerned about potential incompatibility with course requirements, given experiences at other polytechnics.  Comments offer reassurance that Macs are generally acceptable, at least for related courses in previous years, although the official 2025 requirements are yet to be released.

The overall sentiment is one of mild anxiety from the original poster, quickly alleviated by a reassuring comment.  The tone is informal and conversational. The discussion centers around the suitability of specific hardware (MacBook Air M2) for the International Trade course and references experiences at other polytechnics. No specific criticisms of TP's facilities or school management are mentioned, however, the lack of explicit information about laptop requirements is noted as a source of concern for the student.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Proactively publish a clear and accessible list of recommended and/or compatible laptop specifications for all courses well in advance of each academic year. This would alleviate student anxiety and avoid potential problems stemming from incompatible hardware, improving the student experience and mitigating future similar inquiries.  Specifically, the website should clearly state whether MacBooks are acceptable for all courses.
