    "comment": "year 3 here. This course is mainly on logistics, learning warehouse management, freight calculations etc, basically everything u need to work in the logistics industry. It\u2019s not stressful, pretty manageable if u manage yr time well. Year 2 is where all the workload comes in. Curriculum wise it\u2019s 4 day week for me since year 2, come lesson for 2-3 hours.",

    "comment": "i\u2019m a year1 here, the course at least in my first 2 semis here has been pretty chill, the time table hours are definitely less strict than other courses, most of my classes start10 am or later and have around 4-5 hour school days at most. if you wanna score really well for group projects tho i\u2019d say you probably have to do more solo work and be more self independent on asking teachers for consult and arranging meetings. it\u2019s not stressful if you can find a good pair of project mates fast into your sem, and be open if you want to score high cause you will have other ppl who have similar goals but won\u2019t voice out and they would work hard with you. it\u2019s all about trial and error at the end of the day and if you have any other qns also about the school in general and the course just pm me",
