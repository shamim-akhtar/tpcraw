    "comment": "From what i can rmbr, the Aptitude Test was alot of general knowledge and a few riddles regarding math. The interview was a few EAE students sitting in a room and the interviewer asks questions regarding why you want to join Marketing and there was a section where we had to work together to answer questions relating to a prompt. No need to be worried or anxious, if you enjoy marketing, just display yr affection and the interviewers will know it!",
