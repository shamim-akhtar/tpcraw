    "comment": "sem 2 is relatively more chill its the best time out of my 1.5 yrs in poly(as of now), i think its also cos they combined like 2 modules assignment into 1 so like u dun need so rush so much assignments, thrs pros and cons tho, if u r good at it u will do well for both modules if u r bad u will do badly for both modules, but adev and the other one i cant rmb the name is javascript, dsag will continue on python then network will continue on aws",

With sufficient effort and A is attainable for all of the subjects and in my oppinion was way easier than the first sem but it\u2019s much more code based",

I did my cloud practitioner and year1sem2 and year2sem1 both had AWS and it was all incredibly easy while most ppl were struggling. Go on Udemy or YouTube and search \u201cstudy cloud practitioner\u201d you\u2019ll get your resources required. 2 hours a day for a month and you\u2019ve secured a A for two subjects for the next two sems Edit: I\u2019m from Big data, and for us year2 sem 1 also has a AWS subject, but I\u2019m not sure if thatlll be the case for the common ict course. Anyways still reccoment studying for cloud practitioner exam",
