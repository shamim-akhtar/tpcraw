    "comment": "Internal server error because there is no such thing as 'Diploma in Air Management'. It's called Diploma in Aviation Management (T04). Yes the course is available, I have a few friends currently studying the diploma, and it was originally my first choice. Not sure about the application process, you'd probably have better luck emailing TP/ your JC and asking them directly. From what I understand based off your question, you've already completed your A levels? You will have to do the full 3 years, so it depends whether the time spent is of any concern to you. You'll have to take part in the admissions exercise next year and use your O level results. On a different note, don't know which subjects you flunked in your As, but Aviation Management is an engineering course, so you'll be doing a lot of engineering maths and science in your first year. If you're not strong in those subjects, you should still apply if you want, but just note that your first year might be a bit tough if you can't cope.",
