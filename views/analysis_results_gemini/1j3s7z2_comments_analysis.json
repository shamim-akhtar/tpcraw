    "comment": "hi ! 1. honestly, the schedule is relatively relaxed despite the amount of modules and stuff, but u will be given flex week which is a godsend! 2. yes, personally id say do try ur best because, even if GPA isn\u2019t involved, the moment you fail a module you are at risk of being kicked out of poly entirely. Which will force u to restart in ite or sec 5 if available",

I suggest working on flex weeks, study week, vacation, etc. Once your timetable is out, you may reschedule your work dates if you end earlier on certain days.",
