Life was pretty chill in the sense that under the FAST system, we could choose our own core and elective modules and hence our timetable. I remember not coming to campus at all on 1 of the weekdays, so basically just 4 days a week. The downside was in order to cram into 4 days, some days are longer and you have absurd breaks in-between on 1 or 2 days. Like after a lecture on 2pm and the next one is 5pm. I think there are more projects these days though.",

    "comment": "I would say that polytechnics being a chill institution is NOT ALWAYS true and here's my reason: \\[The following things I am going to say may be triggering! please take it with a pinch of salt\\] >!1. Being in the life in poly is really competitive where people are just competing with other people in their GPA to get to university. I have seen instances like in business and science schools and it really create the atmosphere of the school environment to rather have that stigma around students to compete with one another. I have seen instances where in group project, they would have grivance on that particular person because of his academic performance and therefore not want to work with that person, which extends to the point that it makes school a competition rather than sociable and fun. Compared to other tertiary institution like ITE, the approach to how polytechnic being set is just TOO MUCH and it kind of having people to create a sense of social deduction among one another on who to trust. !< >!2. The content that are being taught is way more advanced that what is normally expected . For example, in my experience in the applied science, when I first studied principles of inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry, I initially thought that the content would be like 100% similar to what I was being taught in ITE but it is way advanced that I need to do a decent amount of updates on my theory. And not to forget, that in polytechnic compared to ITE, it is really a mixed of theory and practical so if you are very weak in theory, you would definitely have a harder time juggling with other modules of similar difficulty and that is what makes it harder than my life in ITE where 60% is practical based and 30% is theory based. !< >!3. The commitment to the polytechnic life is just really too much that I would say that you don't have some time for self care. Committing to the polytechnic life means having to go to cca to boost your portfolio, work on project and then normal study.  Before coming to polytechnic and in my life in ITE, I have plenty of time for self-care despite I have like many modules with just me having to study as per normal. I can do self care like playing genshin impact, league of legends and etc. But now because of projects and so many things going on, I don't have that amount of self care but rather reduced, so much so that I don't have time to play games or even enjoy many games because there are so many games that have been released after the year 2020 where like the pandemic go booming and then the games are developed to cope with people's mood. Games like Zenless Zone Zero, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves, Hogwart Legacy are like the trending games in the market and honestly I wanted to play all of the games but yeah, poly life is just so detrimental to my mental health and my energy level. !< Overall, we cannot assume that after we leave secondary school to a skill-based tertiary institution e.g. Laselle, ITE, Poly, we get the most freedom out of it because the goal for the institution regardless to build up on both our technical skills and soft skills e.g. communication, personal values and entrepreneurship. We all are from different diplomas and we have our own pros and cons in our diploma, so judging different diploma based on how difficult the content is just illogical because at the end, the person who is weak in their academics but has the interest in that particular industry would pass rather than a person who is academically strong but has lack of interest. Determination is key to a successful life in the academics and do not lose the opportunity that you have been given, even if you may not like the course or you feel like certain modules does not benefit you in life. We all have our stories to write, to experience and judge how we view our lives in poly. Just like in the telltale game called the Walking Dead, your choices in whatever you do would determine your fate and change the events. Before I end my message here, I would like to share a bit of a story just for all of you who think if your life in polytechnic sucks or great. In my life in the institution in both ITE and Poly, I have seen many instances of people who are academically weak, who intentionally come late to class, and worst,  just wanting to give up in their academic life and withdraw from the academics. Some is due to mental well being, others just don't want to study anymore and just want to have more freedom in their life, while they said that coming to school is meaningless to him or her. I have seen some of these people, trying to come to school to learn and make friends, and graduate with a smile. But there are some who really cannot do it and just quit. I am one of them that I just wanted to avoid school and self-study because I live at the north-west and TP or ITE is at the Tampines/Simei. But what makes me want to come to school is not about the school life or just wanting to make friends and be like a normal typical student like a stereotypical barbie in a movie. It is about me, making improvements for myself, both my personality and my professionalism. In ITE, I learnt how to take risks and as the nike slogan goes , JUST DO IT! At the same time, I am also improving my mental wellbeing due to the pandemic. In poly right now, as I am mentoring the younger generation while building up my professionalism, I learnt how to be a leader to be there for everyone, while at the same time, building my tolerance with people as I am very anti-social. In life, you cannot stop yourself from learning and make a checkpoint to say that you have reached the checkpoint, you would have to make yourself a better you to catch up with the trends in the market and to be able to make your life more \"chill\". Life's not chill if you don't do anything to make yourself chill. I wish you all the  best in your endeavours!",

    "comment": "as a design student, i can assure you all the stereotype of design students having it 'easier' is certainly not true. this applies to most of my friends in design as well. even though we just finished y1s1, the workload for the first semester is much more than you would expect. well yes, the first two weeks was chill and all. but once all the learning really starts, we have a lot to absorb. indeed, we don't have written exams like other courses. but it doesn't mean we have more time for ourselves. if anything, we probably sleep less than the rest of the courses. we have at least 2 to 3 submissions for a module per semester so far - and we have 6 modules, not inclusive of tpfun. the submissions are the most intense in the last two weeks of the semester. many of us have to balance our assignments and ccas, leaving nearly no time for our personal life - at least for me. to be frank, many of us sleep for less than three hours a day for the two weeks. we don't study, we don't grind - not because we don't need, but we can't. coursework needs constant effort and a lot of time especially if you're a perfectionist like myself. and design is subjective so we wouldn't know exactly our assignments should turn out. we don't have answer keys, we don't have model answers. yes, some people find design more chill but some don't. i'm pretty sure that there are people who have it easier or harder than myself but this is just from my perspective. in a nutshell, no poly course is easy because everyone's definition of 'hard' is different. it's your choice to choose your 'hard'! it's important for us to continue motivating ourselves to improve from who we are yesterday. good luck for poly everyone :D",
