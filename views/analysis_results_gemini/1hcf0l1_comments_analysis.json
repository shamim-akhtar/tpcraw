Even if your diploma isn't really connected to programming, if you are working with computers you'll definitely run into problems where you need programming. Can't use ChatGPT if you don't understand what ChatGPT is giving you.",

    "comment": "I'd say don't worry too much about minimum grade to pass, just try your best to meet the A requirements. If you go in with the mentality that you will just get D then you will definitely get D. Most important is answer every section to the best of your ability. What works for me, treat it like an exam, drink coffee/tea/your preferred beverage and do whatever you do before an exam. Then for your first time doing it (starting out the assignment), try to fill in every section just enough. You can add cherries on top later.",
