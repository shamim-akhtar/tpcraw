Personally, and genuinely, I found year 1 to be the HARDEST like for real. And the easiest was Y2S2/Y3S1 for me. These 2 semesters also happened to be the most credit unit heavy semesters. Do note that in year 1 there were many modules too but the CUs were lower somehow due to 2 CU pass fails. Y1S1 to Y2S1 had many computer related modules such as programming and CAD which I really struggled with. I will admit that I fooled around too much as well and I didn't know how grades in poly worked like fr. I only realized that I was done for when the term \"Indicative Grade Profile\" was introduced in Y1S2 during a form class lesson. I thought from there on to just keep my GPA above 2 and go to some private university. However COVID came and all of a sudden there was SO MUCH MORE TIME to study and sleep. Also, the after Y2S1 there were no computer related modules and I started finding things more manageable but still tough. I got 3.5 for Y2S2 and my GPA was 2.7 or something, I then calculated that I just need to repeat this for the last year and my CGPA would be above 3 and I would be able to try for SIT. Somehow I managed to do better than expected and get 3.69 and then 3.5 for the internship. After all of that, I even calculated what my GPA would have been if I didn't fool around in my first half of poly, I got a figure of somewhere between 3.3-3.4 CGPA, and I realized I still wouldn't have made it into NTU either way \ud83d\ude05 so there's that. Assumption was B+/A for everything except computer related modules where I would get D+ to C+ max. TLDR; Y1S1 is not necessarily the hardest, Y1 was the hardest for me and it could be the same for a select few too.",
