    "comment": "hi wld like to help if its not too late? some courses especially comm design is incredibly competitive in EAE and sometimes the course chair will only select ppl who put comm des in first choice as it shows passion (for eg IAD only selects first choice students and ignores even second choice) im not saying you shouldnt mention it in your interview but i dont think it would help? seeing as they would be lecturers from PED and not CMD good luck! (ped is our smallest course and q hard to get into too due to limited slots so do what u will with that info!) feel free to hmu if u got more qns",

    "comment": "PED takes in about 40 in total and max 20 students from EAE due to its special case of 50% allowance from EAE. definitely mentioning during the interview may spark something, but it doesn't mean they would have a definite chance of getting in or even be shortlisted. But the least OP can do is to be honest.",
