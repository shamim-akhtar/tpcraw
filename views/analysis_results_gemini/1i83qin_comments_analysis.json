I also thought i could pull through\ud83d\udc80 and i almost did until 6month intern i couldnt fucking take it anymore. I think you can try to get some meds first or counselling. If those dont work honestly i would just change diplomas man, if your parents permit of course. (Alternatively you can take a gap year) feel free to drop me a dm if you wanna ask/vent about stuff Edit: okay now that im reading this idk your situation so this isnt the best advice ongod but i wouldnt rule out the idea.",
