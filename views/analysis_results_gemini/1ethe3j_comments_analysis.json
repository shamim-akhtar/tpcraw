Didn\u2019t realise Global studies was lol and my teacher was a piece of work. agile methodology design thinking(I think that\u2019s its name) is pretty good, teaches you about SCRUM framework and AGILE methodology which companies actually use(albeit they don\u2019t follow scrum 100% but take bits and pieces). There\u2019s a certification for it that normally costs $150USD but you can get a discount for $50USD and get a refund if you pass(need to get like 80/90% I can\u2019t remember)",
