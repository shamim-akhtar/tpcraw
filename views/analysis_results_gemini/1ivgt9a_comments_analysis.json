And yeah, I received the enrollment package after my course offer, but the guide includes all the details without a clear order. That\u2019s why I\u2019m unsure about the next steps, like how to get the IPA letter. I\u2019m also waiting for an email from the polytechnic and have no idea what to do next. For that reason, I am here to seeking help. Really appreciate your help.",
