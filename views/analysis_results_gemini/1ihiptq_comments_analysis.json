    "comment": "Hii omg I love answering qns so dw about having too many qns: 1. MBT has quite a lot of MBT-oriented overseas trips actl. In 2023, the lecturers organised a trip to go bangkok: we visited the university, got to know about the experiments they do there and had a thai-sg-vietnam exchange sesh! We also visited a hospital and got to see their lab! They were analysing tissue samples etc. and I think foetal samples? (In y1 i was completely lost so half of the info went in and out whilst they were doing the guided tour \ud83d\ude05) Then in 2024, they organised a trip to go japan (we visited tokyo & shizuoka): we visited a hospital in shizuoka and the doctors gave us a talk on their academia & career progression etc. We also visited various agri-tech companies! There was also a trip to go korea in feb 2024, but y1s couldn\u2019t sign up back then, only y2&3s. In 2025, they\u2019re organising a trip to Australia (Gold coast and I think melbourne?) idk the itinerary tho + its only open to current y1-y3 MBT + PHS students > they\u2019re going in march! For your batch will have to wait for more info. Note that the MBT-specific trips are not subsidised so you\u2019ll need to pay around 1-3k to the school for airplane, lodging and meals. Price differs on where the destination is. However, if you can\u2019t afford the MBT-specific trips, there\u2019s always the global studies trips! Global studies is a mandatory module all the TP students need to take, you can choose to go on the trip (heavily subsidised) or to stay in sg and do the project. Its more of a take picture and reflect kinda project. For the rest of this question: camps and festivities.. hmm Idk why but every halloween there\u2019s always a ASC study club organising a halloween rave (im not a party goer but that has happened for both halloweens ive been in TP). For camps, you defo can\u2019t miss Day 3 of the freshmen orientation :) It\u2019s called regatta and its this super big event where the whole y1 cohort for all 6 schools will gather at bedok reservoir for a dragon boat race To be honest, most of the learning journeys, networking opportunities etc. are not served on a platter to you in TP, you need to keep an eye out for MSTeams announcements, email etc. (and TPOei) to be able to sign up for these stuff. And they\u2019re usually quite competitive \ud83d\ude05 The surest way to gain access to these announcements would be to get into TP\u2019s LEAD Programme. Basically it\u2019s a programme for the top 10%? (I think) of your course\u2019s cohort and those with a main committee position in any of the CCAs. I think you can easily get into the LEAD programme by getting a gpa of 3.8+ in y1s1? Thats juz q1 omg okay wait i gotta split this lol.",

For notes, I used to write them out, but as you progress the content gets more and more and you have less and less time to hand write everything out\u2026 so now I type out all my notes into one note! I still handwrite my tutorial answers on ipad tho, need to practice writing so I don\u2019t die from hand pain during exams",

    "comment": "4. Oohh good question. To be honest? For my batch, there was quite a bit of knowledge gap and workload gap between y1 and y2. You really needed to read up a lot (through reference text provided, googling & chatgpt-ing) and questions were really less of memorisation and more of application for some modules. For those that still required intense memorisation? The content was ginormous. I frankly died. (Laughs in 500 slides for term test 1 in y2s2) But issok im holding on and alive. I\u2019m not too sure about your batch tho, cause I think the y1 syllabus changes every year\u2026 (for e.g. the batch before mine, digitalisation in applied science was graded, then in my batch it was pass/fail and this time around it\u2019s graded again\u2026) 5. Adding on to my answer in question 4, I think my y1 timetable was more chill, less classes started at 9am. These past 2 semesters while I have a few days off, most of the days I have class at 9am. Timetable is a little difficult to answer as it really differs from person to person.",

    "comment": "6. Hmm I\u2019m assuming when you say lab you mean like our lab lessons. The max hours I\u2019ve had in lab for a singular module was 4h. But also depends on your timetable cause they can put 2 back to back lab sessions that can add up to be about max 8h. But they\u2019ll probably give breaks if the content isn\u2019t too heavy. Oh but I\u2019ve had a module where the lab session overran by 1h before. So 3h lab turned into 4h (supposed to end at 6pm but ended at 7pm instead) Ah whilst I\u2019m on the topic of lab, back to q1, ASC has this programme where you can sign up to take up ongoing research projects during the semestral breaks! Each project usually takes in about 2-3 students so it can get quite competitive Edit: oops missed out the part about how much of the lab is graded.. uhh depends from module to module but around 30-40%?? Like some modules there\u2019ll be lab tests worth 20% each where your laboratory skills and basic lab math is tested (microscopy, staining, cell count are some tests I can think of) then alongside those tests some modules, as mentioned earlier, have this project which spans across multiple months/weeks where you perform the experiment, record the results then submit a report that\u2019s also graded. (But for these the results don\u2019t really matter, more of your analytical skills) (these are also around 20-25% per component?)",

    "comment": "7. I think I had a lot more projects in y1 than y2. Y2 projects are more cumulative but yes we do have projects often. Usually 1 group project per module! But that group project can encompass across multiple components e.g. your slides (15%) then presentation another (15%) or something. Then sometimes they\u2019ll throw in a group/individual report based on the experimental project you did as a group! 8. Around 20-25 ppl per class! There\u2019s 4 MBT classes, with 1 class entirely comprised of ppl from CSP. (Pssst: Get along with people from other classes! Every class has a different timetable so sometimes other classes get to do their presentation first so you can ask them what the questions the lecturer asked!) > QNA is usually individually graded (normally 5%!)",

    "comment": "9. Hmm some advice I can offer.. Networking is key! Get along with your peers and lecturers, even those from outside of MBT! To help with networking, I recommend joining a CCA that really aligns with your interests. But if you\u2019re aiming for a good balance between your studies & CCA, I won\u2019t recommend a sports/arts cca cause of higher commitment levels. Also if you want a leadership position, I feel like unless you\u2019re really good at time management, I recommend only taking a leadership position up in y3. Whilst you\u2019re studying, find out what you\u2019re really passionate about. MBT has 5 electives that you can choose at the end of y2: cardio tech, clinical lab, research, pharm & manufacturing + marketing (sci products related). For me I got into clinical lab cause I really love handling blood samples and the analysis of these human samples are really interesting and fun for me hehe. Sorry if my answers are soo long I\u2019m really yappy lol",
