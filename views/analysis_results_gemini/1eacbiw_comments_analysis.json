Why do you want to join this course? Why do you think you should be picked over others? What do you know about this course? Can you share more about your personal experience? [ questions in your portfolio /related experience to the course] But you should be knowledgeable on the course you want to EAE to.  Around 3-5 people in the group.",

Do you have any related experience to the course? 3. questions about your portfolio or things you shared in Q1/2. Elaborate more? 4. Why is this course your 2nd/3rd choice? 5.why do you want to join this course? Technically they're trying to see if you fit in the course, you should have general knowledge about the course. Please don't say something that you are unclear of. Please know that it might not always be these questions. Just for your references.",
