    "comment": "no. after visiting the country, you will be given ONE WEEK to do a graded video presentation on one aspect of culture of the country you visited. however, your presentation can also be on another country. you are given a list of countries to choose from so most students do not choose the country they visited, they just choose the \"easiest\" country. but i think it's better to do the country you visited because you can include your own photos and videos in your presentation. at the end of the semester, you have to do a 1200-word essay on cultural differences. i was supposed to go to india for GS as i already visited all the other countries offered, and i was looking forward to it. i was so upset when the trip to india got cancelled and i didn't get to go overseas. for my presentation, i ended up doing one on myanmar LOL",
