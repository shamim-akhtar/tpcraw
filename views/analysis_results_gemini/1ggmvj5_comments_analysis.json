    "comment": "Y1 3.8 GPA here. My honest advice to you is, practice. Tech is not something that you can rely on school to learn, you really need to put in your own effort. School can't possibly cover all the technologies or methodologies used in the real world, and it doesn't. Hence when you graduate, and enter the working world, you will need to continue learning all these technologies on your own. So if you are struggling with NECT, open up packet tracer, and mess around. Build some network. Follow the guides on Netacad, since it seems like we will be using packet tracer for the whole subject. It'll be worth it, your grades will thank you. Same for ADEV, DSAG, whatever. For ADEV, build your own website with HTML/CSS/JS. Whatever website you want, however dumb it is. (BTW, I checked with my teacher, we will be using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) for the JS part, so you can go learn that ahead of time if you want.) Same for DSAG, go review the videos, memorize the big O notation meanings, write the algorithms yourself to understand them better. Sometimes having a different person explain it to you helps, so if you cannot get what your teacher is saying, try looking up the subject on Youtube. The good thing about tech is that everything can be learnt online, so there'll definitely be videos and articles about it. And even better, since the computer is the source of truth, you can verify if what you learnt is correct just by checking if it runs. If you're struggling, in tech, it means you need to practice. If you want to go further, not just in school but also in your career, you can start by reading technology news (e.g. at /r/programming or [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)). Even if you don't understand, having exposure to what is happening in the tech world is very useful.",

    "comment": "My advice to you is, chatGPT. HOWEVER, this does not mean you should rely on chatGPT for answers. What i mean is that if you don't know what to do AT ALL, you can refer to chatGPT to get a start on the assignment. However, do not fully rely on chatGPT to finish this assignment, this can help you better understand the subject and know what to do in the future. This assignment is mostly reliant on the research you do, especially in step 2 as you research about IaaS, SaaS and PaaS. As the other comment states, you should mess around with the packet tracer. This way you can form a better understanding on how to use it, which can help make this assignment \"easier\" to do.",
