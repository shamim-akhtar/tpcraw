Example, a qn holds 2.5 marks (worth 5 qns) which can greatly bring down a grade if not answered well. Having 2-3 of the 2.5 marks qns wrong can bring you to a D easily\u2026. Quite unfortunate but thats how it is. Even though it wasnt hard for us, i can understand why one with not much experience would struggle.",
