    "comment": "It seems easy to do which is why many chose it. Problem is that when they use variables to explain the separation of entities or the \u201ccommon\u201d variables, it was poorly explained and they never really considered a lot of factors. It was extremely tricky and no one in my class who did Venn diagram actually scored well.. I personally used one of the teacher\u2019s recommended ideas and got an 18/20 for coordinate geometry. If you can\u2019t think of an idea, don\u2019t force it",
