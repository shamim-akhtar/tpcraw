    "comment": "for y1, yes all shld have, can refer to this:  https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/students/schools/asc/medical-biotechnology.html if u take additional maths in sec school, it will be an advantage for mas module coz easier for u to understand concepts. For chem, shld be fine, most of it similar to pure chem if u take, i think most of the lecturers teaching chem is quite okay aso. For bio, think theres basic microbiology & cell biology which will they teach ltr ah, there\u2019s also hands on it also. For the bio module, its defo more elaborated information compared to sec school. Tests usually 15-25% if im not mistaken for y1 (correct me if im wrong cos y2, some of the modules for term test % differs). Don\u2019t think theres any semestral exam, only for SAS which is usually y1, sem 2. (Semestral exam has more weightage, if i remember correctly, prolly 30-40% ish? ) But ya, applied science relies alot more on hands on (skills test, which u will have for bmic/pipc), term test & grp/indiv projs. Try to score well for y1 lol bcs i regret it alot, my mas module pull my whole gpa down",

For bio, they will rlly start from scratch on the cell nutrients/media/phases etc so don\u2019t hv to worry sm, also enjoy ur holidays LOL bc once poly start, won\u2019t rlly got tht much time",
