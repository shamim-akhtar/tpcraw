Makeup lessons are usually done if u missed out smtg important especially if it\u2019s needed for you to understand a certain concept for hands on test/debrief. Also, are you going overseas for study purpose/family matters or leisure? bc smts they may be quite strict if u take loa for no reason/deem as invalid & ur loa may get rejected.",
