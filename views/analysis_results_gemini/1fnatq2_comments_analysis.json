Stay focused on your work. Ask your lecturer for help if you need it. Answer questions in class, even if you're not sure of the answer. Try to be more interested and see learning as actual fun, even though it can be hard and tiring. Don't say things like \"I'm cooked,\" as if it's something cool. Language is important. You know what you have to do. It isn't hard to know where you're going wrong. You're an adult now. So just do it.",
