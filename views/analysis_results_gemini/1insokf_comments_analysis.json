    "comment": "your GPA is highly reliant on the competency of your tutors and the type of groupmates you have. of course your consistency matters too. especially for project-based modules, some tutors are way more strict than others in grading. for BTA, about 80% of my classmates and the other class being taught by the same tutor got Cs and Ds - i kid you not, the tutor did warn us that he will only be giving 1-2 As and Bs. meanwhile, other classes with lenient tutors had mostly As. your groupmates matter unless you want to carry the entire burden of the group project on your shoulders AND you are confident of your competency. it is a group effort for a reason, but you will realise some people will treat it as a group half-effort or a group no-effort. find students that are serious and committed just as you are. unfortunately, the only way to find out which classmates to avoid is to actually work with them. some classmates may seem hardworking and get stellar grades in individual assignments but are actually so useless in group projects - it's almost like you have to flip a coin. everyone starts in y1 trying to conquer a high GPA but it is only achieved by a small number of the cohort. by y2, your motivation dips significantly. so this is the time to have fun, get a part time job maybe, go for CCAs regularly, eat out with your classmates. because i'm telling you that y1 is SO EASY. business and all BUS courses are known to be cliquey and people tend to stay with the same clique throughout poly life, even after they have changed classes. so find a solid group of friends. DO NOT keep to yourself during orientation. the person you talk to during orientation is likely to be your friend in the first semester of y1. casual bullying can be rampant as well, people just don't hear of it because it's unreported to the authorities. however, things spread like crazy. try not to get involved. it is competitive so as much as you should find hardworking students, avoid students that are desperately trying to outperform their classmates. sure, it works in individual assignments, but they are a pain in group projects. whenever you get a new lecturer, flip a coin. they will either be so useful or so useless and undedicated to their job. if you get the latter, make sure you watch the weekly lectures and slides. contact students who are in classes with good lecturers for tips. your classmates and other students are usually more than willing to share their knowledge with you. wishing you all the best in TP!",

    "comment": "Hi I just finished my y1 in diploma in business! I would reco definitely to make friends during FO or during regatta and if ur looking for a high gpa I wld defo recommend finding those who r really studious and a small group (I made friends with 2 4.0s) try and find those who u wld think r reliable when it comes to doing grp projects and assignments tgt coz for most of the modules u can choose ur own group so its rlly impt to find a solid grp So if u feel like ur school life is kinda boring cuz of this like not fun friends join a club!! Whether it be a cca or a p10 club, i wld defo recommend joining a club and if u wnna strive for leadership positions join a p4 club! u can find a bond of close friends tgt aside from class! For ur first sem u wont have a lot of written test papers but more grp projects indiv assignments (if u need help dm me!) so its lesser reliance on memorising and more how u apply what u learned bah its easy to score a high gpa as long as u LOCK IN. Like listen in class listen to ur tutors and always always do ur lectures before class if not no point in going for class good luck for y1! It can be fun if u make the right friends ;)",
