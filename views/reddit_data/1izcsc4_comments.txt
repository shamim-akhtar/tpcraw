Comment by TurtleRiskyBoi: For yr1 sem1 u dont rlly need high specs cos the most u wld run is python. But from yr1 sem 2 onwards, u wld run stuff like 3d modelling and simulations so it needs a laptop that can meet the requirements. Other than to run those, u can use anything rlly.

Comment by Asleep_Market1202: They won’t *force* you to buy a Windows laptop, but they’ll probably strongly recommend it, especially if certain software isn’t Mac-compatible. Most lecturers just care that you can run the required programs—if you can find workarounds (Boot Camp, Parallels, cloud alternatives), they’ll likely close one eye. Worst case, you might have to use school lab PCs for some tasks. If you're worried, just email them and check.
