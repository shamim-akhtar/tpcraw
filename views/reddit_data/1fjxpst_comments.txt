Comment by No_Astronomer2047: there are so many scholarships you can apply for, try to find them and don’t miss out especially with a 4.0 gpa and a cca, you’re definitely going to get it!  i applied for TP scholarship in y1 and it’s so worth it. but at that point of time, my gpa was 3.8 but i didn’t have a cca and i still got selected so you definitely will be a good candidate! good luck!

Comment by Gumi_Kitteh: Check brightspark website, need a lot of data entry in your profile though.. it's like a one-stop site for most scholarships with criterias listed out, don't stuck your eye to ur poly scholarship only
