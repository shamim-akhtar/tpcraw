Body: I'm a current IIT y1 student and is it just me or I feel super overwhelmed by everything? For ADEV they chose to teach the more important one like 2 weeks before the deadline for the assignment and I'm so burnt out trying to understand and figure out everything ğŸ« ğŸ« ğŸ«  There's literally so many assignments that I have to tackle but I'm too unmotivated for anything. 

and like the teaching materials low-key don't help much ğŸ˜­ I resort to using the internet/YouTube to even understand what the teachers are teaching. I feel like I'm losing out on so many things when I compare myself to peers who have experience in all this ğŸ˜­
