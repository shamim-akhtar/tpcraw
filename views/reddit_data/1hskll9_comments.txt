Comment by canontan: Steep learning curve, hard on the body due to the many breakfalls, pain in fingers from gripfighting, super cardio intensive. That being said, stick with it and it'll become fun, you'll tone your physique, and you'll learn one of the most realistic martial arts out there (and the only realistic one that TP offers) for self defense.

Comment by Desperate_Wall_6828: ikr. wished tp offered more. thanks for letting me know. if u dont mind me asking, r u in judo now? for how many years? do u go for competitions or anything like that?

Comment by canontan: Haha, frankly speaking I only dabbled in it for a few months, just learned a basic breakfall and maybe 3 throws. I can't comment on what it's like to compete or longterm training, you can try contacting their instagram page for more info from their members.
