Body: I've realised some people are truly fucking shit, be it in and/or out of class. Like during grp projects they're lazy af and don't actively do anything, sometimes I feel like a fucking kindergarten teacher trying to get people to do something. FFS how useless can you be, can you help. But I can't get myself to call them out since most of the people in the group don't do anything, and I have a grp project due on Friday NOBODY IS FUCKING DOING ANYTHING. I check my ppt after we agreed to work on it tdy and I"M THE ONLY ONE ONLINE DOING SHIT. I Have to call them out to do shit, and haven't been able to sleep well bc of this fucking project yet everyone acting all happy-go-lucky.
