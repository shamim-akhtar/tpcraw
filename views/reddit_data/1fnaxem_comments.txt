Comment by Alpha-232: You can try to apply for other scholarships when you are in your year 2, given that you do well for the subsequent semester and participate in CCAs.

Comment by butteryink_2007: Not sure if this helps, but I am applying for the NTUC Starter Awards because apparentlyÂ the GPA requirement on their website is just 3.0. It seems this scholarship focuses more on CCAs and leadership experience.Â This is the link that I applied with:Â https://www.lit.sg/ntuc-starter-awards
