Comment by Holiday_Stick3341: i think as long as it is able to use microsoft etc. also idt engineering can tho, need special laptop! (this is if u are in eng)

Comment by Street_Musician_580: I really don't think chromebooks are supported as you might have to run softwares or whatever. You could check the tp website for the list of recommended devices available! I think Asus Vivobook TN3402YA is pretty okay, has a way bigger screen than your chromebook, it has the touchscreen functions like the chromebook, one of the high end laptop options, and also quite affordable (I'm currently using it). I got it at 1.4k at harvey norman, there was a discount!

Comment by PossessionOk5665: Hi everyone do they have any bundle sales in tp? Just like secondary sch for pld? Or do we have to purchase on our own?

Comment by DivoKing69: I think chromebooks might be lacking in the specs especially cpu and gpu as well as ram . It might just be better to buy a new laptop when to releases list of recommended laptops

Comment by UpbeatHour7206: oh im in chemical eng!!

Comment by UpbeatHour7206: alright thank you for your suggestion!

Comment by mount2010: There are two financial aid schemes for those who are eligible, one of them is "you buy the device yourself, they refund you $1000 later" and the other one is "we cover $1000, you pay the extra amount for a laptop we choose".

There isn't a "bundle sale" per se, but the second option is more like that (I took the second option).

Comment by Holiday_Stick3341: ohh!! best to check the tp website for any special requests. if ur chromebook can that, can use that!
