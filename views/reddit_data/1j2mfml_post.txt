Body: Hi, not too sure whether this is an appropriate place to post this but I saw someone else post this and wanted to try my luck too.

I'm looking to join a Jrock/Jpop/Anisong band as the title says. I've been playing for about 2 years now and I don't have any prior gig experience. Looking for a band who's preferably willing to get serious about things and release original music also. My top artists currently are Cö Shu Nie, Zutomayo, Kessoku Band, Kenshi Yonezu, King Gnu, Vaundy, Yoasobi, and Hitsujibungaku. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions :D
