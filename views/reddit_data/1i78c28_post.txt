Body: Hey!ðŸ˜… So im (16m) hoping to get into Temasek poly computer engineering and I was wondering if guys in engineering courses are homophobic? For context, I dont really "act" or "look" gay (whatever that means ðŸ’€) so like the only way people can infer is through how i text(?) Or if i out right tell them. Just asking to ease my nerves cause i find it hard to make friends with guys if I know there is a high chance they are or are homophobic ðŸ˜… like bro im not into you, i just wanna be friendsðŸ˜­

Anyway, thanks for reading and hope to see yall in comp engineering!
