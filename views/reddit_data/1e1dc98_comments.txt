Comment by Sea-Policy1707: I did the aptitude test like 2 years ago. It was like mcq questions regarding the current economic situation, what’s the capital city of a certain country, and who’s the president of a country. 

They asked two open ended questions that year, which was on AI. One of it I could rmb clearly, it is “do you think AI would replace accountants in the future” 

The questions are kind of randomized cuz I asked my friends and they got different questions from me, but quite similar ones. anyways good luck for ur aptitude test. Jia you!
