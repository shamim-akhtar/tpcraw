Body: failed my MST and i'm struggling to understand what is happening, lecturer encouraged to go for a retest since the marks are really low (expected ngl) 

i have no friends in class and honestly don't know who to seek help from to get a better understanding of econsðŸ˜­ (would really help if anyone could share their econs notes / tips on studying it)
