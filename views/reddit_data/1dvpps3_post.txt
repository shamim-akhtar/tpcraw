Body: Hey guys! I'm a student from ITECC and I just got the apititute test for Psych Studies. This is going to be my second time doing it and I just want to get a sensing on what they are actually looking for... I did the test last year and didnt make it so I'm curious for those who made it past the test what were your responses like?

I gave things by the textbook last year ðŸ¤§
