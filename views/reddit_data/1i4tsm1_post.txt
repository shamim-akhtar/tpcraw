Body: to the asc y2 and y3 students, how did u guys manage to get through y1 sem 2 (specifically the last term)? there is so much unnecessary group projects and assignments which im sure yall have done in y1 as well, on top of that, term test 2 contents are SO HEAVY for modules like nuh and cbb :’) (cbb’s slides are TERRIBLE i barely understand anything) since the term is ending soon, are there any advice or tips yall can give to us y1 asc kids who are currently struggling to cope w school rn😭😭😭 i know time will eventually pass and itll all be over soon but idk, i just feel like theres wayyyyyy too much to learn and keep up with at the moment :]

also another question, whats the workload (assignments, group projects, module contents) in y2 like? are they more worse and difficult compared to y1 or are they roughly about the same? thank u in advance!🙂‍↔️
