Comment by _captain_-_obvious_: 1. Try your best to bring your gpa up, like 4.0 every sem from now onwards

2. Private uni

3. During internship try your best to suck up to everyone, do your best, impress you supervisor... so that when at the end of internship they can offer you full time aft graduating poly

Comment by Ok-Engineering143: i get you ,same poly, same experience .
Terrible curriculum which includes confusing lecture notes and tutorial questions as well as an overload of exams and tests and icqs on a daily basis , with lectures having unexpected expectations to do everything on your own sdl. Its no wonder why some of us do well to go uni. Anyways , theres nothing we can do about it but adapt to the system , try to embrace chatgpt and certain online resources if possible if consultations with lects or friends dont work, im also not sure hkw ima oull my goa up this sem but gd luck

Comment by Lets-huddle: Donâ€™t sweat it, my GPA was horrible and as a result I started being more active in CCA. Ended up getting to Uni through discretionary admissions.

Most importantly, pursue what you are good at and enjoy the process.

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: change course / work hard to get 4.0 for this sem / work on yr extracurriculars
