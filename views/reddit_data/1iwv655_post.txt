Body: Hello! It has become clear that IIT y1 was way more challenging than most of us anticipated. However, we did not have a reliable resource to turn to back then. We want to change this, which is why a group of friends and I have started up a moderated, community discord server for TP IIT!

This server is meant to serve as a moderated community to help new and current students with coding, schoolwork, assignment clarification, etc. We don't want students to have to struggle with unclear marking rubrics or the like, as I'm sure many y1s are familiar with. 

Of course, this is not only for IIT students, or even students in general. IIT Lecturers, students from other diplomas, y'all are also free to join! We mainly just want to create a helpful community.

Also, because I know some will ask this, we chose discord over telegram and WhatsApp because it's easier to create and manage communities on discord. If you don't have a discord account, it's free to make.
