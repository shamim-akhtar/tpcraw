Body: Hi there!I am a PFP student that will enroll into TP this April in T50 Aerospace electronics,however T50 was not my first choice and I wanted aviation management[T04] but I lacked 2 more points to meet the cut off point for it and got T50 instead and I really want to know if I could change courses in year 1 so that I can get my desired course,thanks
