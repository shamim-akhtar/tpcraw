Comment by ascendingg_: there’s matcha at the barista machines along business / engineering blk 10!

Comment by EfficientResult1629: usually i just make it myself in the tumbler, q easy to make just shake my tumbler containing matcha powder, cold water and ice is a must for the sound effects!!

otherwise i don't think they sell cold matcha in campus, if u dont mind matcha latte maybe can find in those fridge at drink stalls/triplets

Comment by Kitapitapy: Idk I think the closet is green milk tea from teatree LOL if not just go to like Tampines west cc there's probably better matcha there or even better go to Tampines central 😔
