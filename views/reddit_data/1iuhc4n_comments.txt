Comment by AtomZones: You’ll literally have to TRY to fail

Comment by PalpitationLate7376: how to fail cict 😭 js don't be a clown wadafak

Comment by nothappygooutside: yes i've seen it before. someone failed the entire thing because of one assignment, he didn't read the instructions properly and wrote something completely irrelevant. 

CICT is usually non-graded so just put minimal effort in it to pass. but the keyword is minimal effort, not lacklustre effort, so make sure to read the marking rubrics before each assignment.

Comment by Hopeful_Sea78: only possible to fail due to attendance

Comment by DistinctSouth: Yes, my friend Justin failed

Comment by Odd_Substance336: hi i just remod cict this sem so yes its possible😂😂

Comment by diorlysa: omg that sucks... then what did the guy do in the end? Did he remod? Because I really think I might fail...

Comment by diorlysa: wait why? isit bc attendance or the assignment

Comment by nothappygooutside: um... we actually had a falling out and cut contact so i don't know how he performed for his remod, but he did post on his story his grades for sem 1.1 and his CICT was a "Fail". i assume he did remod as i continued seeing him in school. 

if you fail any subject then you'll have to remod! thankfully CICT is not graded, so you really just need to put in the bare minimum to pass next time. and this won't affect your gpa but you are no longer eligible to get a diploma with merit or be in the director's list.

Comment by diorlysa: oo okay, I was so worried tht failing cict wld affect my gpa. thank you for helpingg (⁠*⁠´⁠ω⁠｀⁠*⁠)
