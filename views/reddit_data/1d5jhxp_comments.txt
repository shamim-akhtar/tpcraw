Comment by Deadlock64: If ur GPA is good i bet they will take into consideration. 
Im from Nitec to Poly with 3.8 Gpa. So if u meet requirements. With good GPA, portfolio i bet they will.

Comment by NyandaKun: Hi, I was previously from Higher Nitec too. Do check the diploma offered under higher nitec of sports management. As Aviation management is not under school of business, I think your only choice to enroll in aviation management is through early admission exercise.

Comment by Broad-Advertising-65: Juz try anyway

Comment by JackAllTrades06: Just try. If your GPA is good enough, no reason why they will reject. But do take note, if you take a different course totally different from your current course, might find it difficult  to catch up.

Comment by Issa3_kun: Dw bro as long your GPA within the requirements of the course that you are going, there should be not prob when you're applying. Also jus make sure that your portfolio has aviation management stuff instead of your previous course materials and try to research more on aviation management too.
