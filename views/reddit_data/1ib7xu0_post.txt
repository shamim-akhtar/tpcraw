Body: After I have found out that I have partial red green color blindness, I still want to apply for the b.med science but Im also on the risk of failing their medical check up. The main thing I want to ask is if I failed the check up and had to give up on my first choice, do I still get to choose my second/third choices or will they just assign me a suitable course?
