Body: Hi, I think I lost my wallet. I don't know where exactly it could have dropped, however I spent most of my time today in the IIT block, at 03-05-55. 

My wallet is long and black, with polaroids and photo strips. It has my NRIC, my poly ezlink and my sec school ezlink card. 

If anyone has seen it, (or can help me check the classroom) for it, I would really appreciate it, thank you
