Comment by wank_for_peace: Find it hard to believe that in 2024, they only accept AXS.

What they teach in poly? Year 2000 stuff?

Comment by grandmasterlau: The AXS payment is available through their app or eService which is linked with Nets, VISA/Master, PayNow.

Otherwise you could try calling the student centre, but I suspect they are not keen on cash or nets payment.
