Hi! To anyone who's taken this module before, may i ask for tips on answer formats/tips on how to structure answers for the written exam?

I'm quite cooked because i don't understand how to intepret the questions sometimes. For example a tutorial question under contract law asked if a honeymoon suite (part of wedding package) was a warranty/condition/innominate term. 

I thought it was quite straightforward, but the lecturer used CRAZY mental gymnastics and talked about how many luggages the couple would bring, how many people would be in the room, and how particular a bride would be about the size+quality of the room (???)

Anyway my lecturer is quite terrible! But I'm also terrible at understanding him! Yes we go through tutorial questions but i walk away thoughroughly confused!

I would be eternallyyy grateful if anyone has tips or even examples of how to structure an answer during the exam! Or general tips on how to analyse questions and do similar mental gymnastics
