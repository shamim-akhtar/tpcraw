Body: How is this even fair? The School of Informatics & IT (IIT) run things  makes it feel like a cruel joke. The incompetence, inconsistency, and outright neglect are beyond comprehension. It’s as if the school is going out of its way to make students’ lives harder.

# NECT: 

Let’s talk about NECT . Why were the quiz topics and details only released *one week* before the exam? ONE WEEK. What were they doing during the entire holiday? Sitting around? Students could have used that time to prepare properly, but instead, they were thrown into a panic because the school couldn’t be bothered to plan ahead. How is this even remotely acceptable? Are we supposed to pull miracles out of thin air?

# Mock Quiz: 

And then there’s the so-called mock quiz for NECT. What a joke. It doesn’t even show you which questions you got wrong! How are we supposed to learn from our mistakes? Are we psychic? Is the school trying to *hide* the answers so we stay confused? The whole point of a mock quiz is to help students improve, but apparently, the school doesn’t care about that. It’s like they don’t even want us to succeed.

# ADEV Consultations: 

Now let’s move on to ADEV (Application Development). Some classes get consultations, and others don’t. How is this fair? Why are some students given extra support while others are left to fend for themselves? Are we not all paying the same tuition fees?

# Teaching Critical Topics: 

And what’s with teaching crucial ADEV topics during e-learning, right before the submission deadlines? This is not just poor planning—it’s sabotage. Students don’t even have the chance to properly understand the material or get help from their teachers because everything is crammed into a last-minute, rushed format. Are we expected to magically absorb the content and produce high-quality work without guidance? The timing is so bad it feels intentional.

# No Feedback on Projects: 

After projects are marked, what do we get? Silence. No feedback, no review sessions, no explanations. Just a grade. How are we supposed to improve when we don’t even know what we did wrong? This lack of follow-up is lazy, irresponsible, and downright disrespectful to the effort students put into their work. If the school doesn’t care about our learning, why should we care about their grading?

# YouTube as a Teacher: 

And finally, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the school’s over-reliance on YouTube videos. Are we at Temasek Polytechnic, or are we enrolled in “YouTube University”? We’re paying thousands in tuition fees, but instead of receiving proper instruction, we’re told to watch a bunch of online videos. Are the teachers too busy? Or does the school think our education isn’t worth their effort? This is not what we signed up for.

How is this fair?
