Hi, a couple of questions. How do I book an appointment at SATA for a colour vision test? The website is so confusing to me ðŸ¥². Also does SATA accept walk-ins? I've been stressing out too much about the colour vision test because I dont know what clinic I could take it in and I have 5 working days to do so ðŸ˜«.

I also would like to know if theres other walk-in clinics that offer colour vision tests.
