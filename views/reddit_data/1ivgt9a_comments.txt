Comment by curiousbean28: IPA comes first then you will need to apply Student pass. For IPA, school will apply on behalf of student if I‚Äôm not wrong, then sch will send you link to make appointment at ICA office. So you will need to wait to get an IPA email first.

Comment by Handrwik: For International students, I just finished enrolment by submitting documents.

Comment by Handrwik: I got with DAE

Comment by curiousbean28: have you received enrollment package email already?

Comment by Procrastinator_L: Alr thanks. üôè

Comment by Fearless_Sky1016: what course?

Comment by Handrwik: Thanks for the information. 
I‚Äôve already completed the document submission stage after online enrolment. 
And yeah, I received the enrollment package after my course offer, but the guide includes all the details without a clear order. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm unsure about the next steps, like how to get the IPA letter. I‚Äôm also waiting for an email from the polytechnic and have no idea what to do next. For that reason, I am here to seeking help. Really appreciate your help.

Comment by curiousbean28: oh i see! IPA letter and student pass application stage dont take long. It only takes like mostly two weeks or three weeks. Don‚Äôt worry about it. I would like to advise to prepare medical records first if u r still in your home country. you can pm me for further information also!!
