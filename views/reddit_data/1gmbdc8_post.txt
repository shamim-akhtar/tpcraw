Body: Basically, flunked my As and realised JC is not for me. Im thinking of going for Diploma in Air Management, but on the TP website the link keeps giving an internal server error. Is the course still available? And how do I go about applying from JC? Do I still have to do the full 3 years or is it shorter? Any info is helpful thanks!
