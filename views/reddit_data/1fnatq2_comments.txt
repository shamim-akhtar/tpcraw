Comment by MathematicianLoud947: Pay attention in class. Do your class work. Don't cheat your way out of assignments by asking friends how to do it. Put away your phone in class. Don't play games in class. Stay focused on your work. Ask your lecturer for help if you need it. Answer questions in class, even if you're not sure of the answer. Try to be more interested and see learning as actual fun, even though it can be hard and tiring. Don't say things like "I'm cooked," as if it's something cool. Language is important. You know what you have to do. It isn't hard to know where you're going wrong. You're an adult now. So just do it.

Comment by alts013: Is your internship graded? That should be worth 4-5 modules worth of As. Your last chance to pull GPA up without mugging. But working life is a different kettle of fish for a lot of students because of the muscle memory of not waking up on time and taking MC.

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: u r still in sem 1, so u still have time to pull upüëç

Comment by SGSweatZ: im IIT with 2.88, also quite cooked.

Comment by jiayiichewww: damm shag sia IT student

Comment by jiayiichewww: ya i think so i am year one so idk

Comment by Artificial_Ascent: yeah as y2 student fyp and internship are both worth 16 cu or 4 A grades

Comment by Logram_: hi just to check is this a build up from the original 32cu. 

So if theres a total of 32 cu in y2 does the fyp + internship add up another 16 cu to make it 48? or is it already included.

Comment by Artificial_Ascent: i believe if y2 is 32 CU then fyp + internship add another 16 CU each so total 64 CU

Comment by Logram_: Oh wow. Alrite thanks
