Comment by mount2010: TP ITSIG has a website about this: https://tp-itsig.github.io/

Basic networking (routers, switches, modems: what they do and how to connect them), user interface design, Python (through Juypter Notebook), Data Structures/Algorithms intro (Python again), computer math (logarithms, boolean logic, functions, etc), HTML/CSS/JS/SQL, data analytics.

**Note** that for our batch that there was **no** introduction to computers or how to use basic Windows features. If you are a student who has no prior computing knowledge, I would highly recommend picking up how to use Windows **now** rather than when you enrol and find yourself lost. I have given feedback about this but I cannot guarantee that they will make modifications based on it.
