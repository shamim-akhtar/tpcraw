Comment by Waste-Swordfish6983: If you get 0.92 over four years, your gpa will be 3.68. Don’t sweat it

Comment by Glum-Trip7191: Bro how is that even possible ? Did you even like the course ?

Comment by Kaywhyn: Damn it’s harder to get 0.92 than 3.5

Comment by Financial_Cover495: Hi,

if you got 0.92, it means that you really are struggling. Think about why you got this GPA in the first place. Is it because of your study habits? Have you been paying attention in class? Do you understand the concepts taught in lectures and tutorials?

If not, maybe you should really reconsider your learning habits now. You should clarify concepts with your tutors in your tutorials, and diligently do your tutorials before class. Ensure you have a good grasp of the material taught in class. 0.92 means that you have probably failed multiple modules – and you’re just Year 1 (Sem 1 if I’m not wrong). The modules will get more complex as the semesters go by, so if you are failing Y1S1, you probably won’t have much luck in the next semesters if you don’t seriously change your study habits and your attitude.

I really mean no offence to you in my comment, and I genuinely wish for you to improve. Even if you get perfect 4.0 for the remaining semesters I don’t think it’s possible to achieve anything above 3.0 (I‘m not sure – maybe max you can get is around high 2??? sorry I don’t have a calculator). Anyway, I wish you all the best in your studies, and don’t give up!

Sincerely,

a Y2

😊

Comment by NyandaKun: When I first read this, I was very confused how you can get 0.92 gpa, cause if you pass all of your modules, minimum should be gpa of 1. 

GPA below 1 is really concerning because I think that something within your module is lacking and you really need to  push yourself even harder in adapting to the learning environment while catching up your studies before the assessments. 

So my advice to you in your next semester is as follow:  
1. Avoid applying for part-time jobs during school term as you need to focus on your studies. If you really do have financial issues, do speak to a counsellor about financial issues and the school would see what they can help you.   
2. Plan your schedules and set your priorities of work based on importance and urgency.   
3. Consult with your lecturers if you do not get what is being taught in a particular topic and do get feedback to help yourself improve.   
4. Do not just read from the lecture notes, but also be able to convey the same idea through writing of your own notes, be vocal to yourself (e.g. do a self lecture by going through the slides - I know it's embarrassing but think of it as like you doing the presentation and a rehearsal) and be proactive some ways that would keep you motivated to study more.   
5. \[Very Important\] Your style of learning is different from everyone and you have to find your own style of learning to become an effective learner. Be yourself!

While you are still year 1, I want to tell you that the future years of your academic will be even tougher and this is what year 1 stuff is training you. So do your best, persevere and all the best in your future endeavours!

Comment by reapertorn: No joke but you probably ain't taking it seriously. As someone that went through 4 years of ite + 2 yrs ns AND THEN coming into poly where my course is my 8th choice, I try to make time to join my clique for study session, ask them for help and clarify anything that I don't know. Sure I'm a 2 pointer ++ but if you really put in effort can one. My maths got a D lol but a pass is a pass considering I failed maths all the way in secondary school and barely even study during my ITE days lol

Comment by RecommendationOk8241: Just get gpa 4 every year to pull up your gpa. Ykyk

Comment by needanotherpudding: Try your best to increase your gpa by next sem if you relly want this course. If not, switch course. 0.92 for first sem is beyond cooked, it is probably not for you. Cut down on games and start studying.

Comment by usermanokok55: Hey. TP Grad here 

Yeah, 0.92 GPA is really, kinda shocking. 

I think the main question is asking yourself about the methods you are implementing in your modules 

Are the modules project based? Exams based? Usually if they are project based you’ll have to plan your time better as you need time to complete them (same as a group project) 

If they are exam based and assuming they have no projects, you should still study quite regularly to prevent yourself from cramping everything at the last minute 

Habits is honestly, just try to at least study/look through the content taught in school daily. Start by 1-2 hours a day and you’ll definitely see some form of improvement. 

However, to address the GPA that you’re getting, I think the main question to ask yourself is, do you like whatever you are doing? Can you do this? Or do you absolutely hate it? 

If you like whatever you’re doing and you’re able to manage, you just need a change of methods of studying and be consistent. But, if you hate whatever you are doing, I’ll recommend for you to drop out 

Had a classmate back then who failed every single mod in Year 1 and only passed SNW 💀. Dropped out the next sem.

So, ask yourself, do you think you like what you are doing?

Comment by beppppp: Maybe start being on time for school and don’t skip it? Lol

Comment by Mackocid6706: You are not cooked. You are chao da. Jokes aside, I agree with one of the other Redditor stating you are not putting in effort. I was from ITE because I flung my Os with a total of 33 points. I regretted a lot because I was lazy. I got back on my feet when I reached ITE. I'm not someone who is good at studying, not 读书料 coz I take a long time and have a hard time understanding things. But I worked hard to at least have a pass. I scored about 2.3 which allowed me to get into poly thu EAE. Year 1 poly I flung math and had to retake this module. I didn't take A-math in poly, and the math in poly requires A math. I had 0 idea what the teacher was talking about. So Y1 Sem 2 on top of the extra math module I had to take, the rest of the sem 2 modules continue on. It was very tough. I would look out the window of my room and just cry, and cry sitting in the corner of my room. But I held on, found myself a tutor, and worked my s off. I finally managed to get it from an F to C grade. 

So, my experience is just to hopefully motivate you study. Please put in effort. Although it looks like there's no hope now, just do the best within your ability right now. You need to push yourself. The sweetness that comes out of your hardwork, is unimaginably sweet. I felt that when I saw my math grade jumped from F to C, for someone like me who is not study material and with no A math background.

Comment by ohayadnez: Don't waste school fees this way... You/ your parents didn't pay thousands for you to not attend lessons. I don't think it's possible to get <1 if you even put in some effort. Maybe you need to sit down and ask yourself what you're hoping to get out of these 3 years in poly? No point paying school fees to end up not even being able to obtain your diploma. Job market also isn't great so if you cant even get a diploma idk how you gonna make a living for yourself in future bro.. On the other hand though, I'm sure you can turn things around if you want it badly enough 💪

Comment by zenjuro: Give yourself a pat on the back for wasting your folks' cash on your education.

Comment by Alert_Pear_8189: Yes

Comment by kaedemiyata: Its okay my friend got 0.85 before

Comment by DFDGON: what were you doing in class? you can get at least a C just by attention. the topics covered in the lessons arent supposed to be that hard because we're year 1s.

just focus in class, dont get distracted. always do your homework and if you dont understand anything, you can ask your peers or teachers for help. if there is an assignment dont finish them on the last day, start as early as possible and divide the work over many days worth of time.

dont worry this is only the first semester, you can make up for it if you dont screw around and work hard for the next 3 years.

Comment by fried_pudding: can see you don't like to study kind.

Comment by fizzywinkstopkek: Very easy thing you can do is to actually start studying.

Comment by PickleJamPie: genuinely i’m surprised i never heard of anyone having a gpa that starts with 0

Comment by adustism: how tf ☠️

Comment by tehobengsiewdai: usually I try my best to give advice to people on how to increase their gpa. But my only advice for you is to drop the course rn while it's early and start a new course next year with a woken idea. <1 gpa is legit cooked 💀

Comment by SheSaidOtaku: Start over and get your shit together. No more buts.

Comment by sprite700: You are leaving out alot of details. Did u study? Did u do all the work assigned? Did u contribute significantly in group work? Did you put in the effort, to research, learn how to answer the questions, and stick to schedule?

0.92 is not normal if you do the above. If u did everything and still got a 0.92, either the course is not for you or poly is not for you. If you need to put in twice as much effort to see the same results as your peers, then do that.

Comment by Kou_Yanagi: Bro are you even going to class?

Comment by LankyProfessor1413: I think you need to think about whether you really have an interest for your course ... Since you're y1 u still have time to change .

Comment by okwhatelse: i got 1.03 gpa, we in the same boat and its sinking

Seen that you mentioned your attendance is poor. Would not like to assume anything, but I believe if your attendance is due to something personal, your lecturers will definitely understand if you tell them. 

However, to address the GPA that you’re getting, I think the main question to ask yourself is, do you like whatever you are doing? Can you do this? Or do you absolutely hate it?

Comment by casper_07: You’re done so start working like u are

Comment by terrisnjw: The most important question is, are you even interested in this course you're taking? If you're not, I personally think it's a better option to drop out.

Comment by KDS2000: bro, i personally feel that if you get below 1.0 GPA per semester got a few possibility you still haven't adjust properly from secondary school. You have been fooling too much and never submit your assignments/projects on time. Talk to your parents if they want to let you try for another 1 more semester. Personally, with a 0.92 GPA, I do not know how are you going to pull the your remaining 2.5 years to a 4.0 GPA. Even if you get 3.0 GPA for the next 2.5 years, your 0.92 GPA will pull your GPA to around GPA 2.65. Might not even be enough for you to qualify for any local university. This is the worst case scenario.

I feel you can start applying for DAE or ask for internal transfer in TP to reset your GPA. If you do not want to go local university and don't mind private university, u can continue to stay on.

Source: When I was in polytechnic Y1 i flunked super badly and my GPA was 0. Cuz i nvr bother going for my final exam. I dropped out from NYP and eventually enrol myself into TP through DAE route.

Comment by Helicitiy: You can consider just dropping out and starting over next year, nothing wrong with that

Comment by JC90x: I would suggest u repeat ur year 1 in another course that you like. 0.92 is impossible to pull up to any meaningful gpa that is gonna impact your life no matter how many perfect semesters you get

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: what course

Comment by ghost_editz: bros COOKED !

Comment by Billyong9: I repeated poly for one year and graduated with a GPA of 1.8. 

Since year 1 I had 0 interest in the course but wasn’t able to change due to my poor o level results. 

Looking back I think having zero interest was just an excuse I gave myself cuz I know of a lot of people that didn’t had interest but they still managed to be quite decent in their grades. 

After a couple of years I managed to get into a private university and got myself a gpa of 3.4 (not the best but coming from a 1.8 gpa in poly I kinda surprised myself) 

There were a few things I did differently in Uni as compared to poly that I hope it can help. 

1. Change of environment
I couldn’t study at home because my gaming PC was just beside me and it was a major distraction. Instead I went to libraries or cafes and stuff my phone deep inside my bag and put it in airplane mode. 

This allowed me to focus better. 

2. Using mind map
I used mind map to first map out all the topics from macro to micro. 

This enabled me to first understand what the heck the module is talking about before I dive into the textbook. 

In poly, I used to just scribble and highlight notes in my textbook but realise I can’t remember anything. 

3. Simplify what you learn so that a kid can understand it. 

After you go through a chapter, try to explain it to yourself or other people like they are kids. Keep it simple and don’t try to use fancy terms. 

Looking back I realised how easy it was for me to do well in poly but I just gave myself the excuse that I’m not interested in the subject. 

Since I was already in it I might as well do my best. 

All is not lost bro, good luck

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: beyond cooked 🔥

Comment by No-Subject-1252: Having a nitec with gpa 1.0 is easier than 0.95 gpa in diploma. Bro you need to pull up ya socks. I am studying spec diploma while working  and in for TP evening classes and i am awaiting my score bro. 

My parents would have told me to go NS if not interested in studying and come back later. They would have said not to waste time.

Comment by randomperson12310: If you think about it 0.92 gpa is basically 1gpa and 1gpa is pretty close to 1.5, however thats not a nice number so your basically 2gpa right now

Comment by frenchbeansoup: I had a similar grade when I was in poly first year. Left without any hesitation and applied for the year after intake 🤣🤣

Comment by Glum-Trip7191: I think for you , it is best to aim for a B first as getting a B is quite manageable, and also try studying with your friends.

Comment by Marriedtotheelephant: You don’t need notes form Y2, you need notes from Y1

Comment by Financial_Cover495: Yes, I believe so – you can ask the Y2s from your course and try to see if they have notes that you can use. I’m in Accountancy and Finance (A&F) though, so I don’t know exactly about your course. Maybe try asking around? 😊

Comment by Sad_Recognition7282: See you next year! 🤗👑🧎

Comment by truck-kun_onegaii: 1. Start fixing your attendance first then ☠️
