Comment by pokkagreentea100: Hi, before I continue, here's a link to the school's academic calendar if you want. https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/for-current-students/academic-calendar.html

Anyway, as Sem 1 starts on 21 April, and based on what I experienced last year, orientation is usually held the week before school starts. 14-17 April, 18 is good Friday. You may want to block out that week if you intend to go orientation.
