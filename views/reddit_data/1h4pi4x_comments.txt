Comment by mount2010: as long as you have more than one broadcast domain (one router interface = one broadcast domain) you can't fail probably. also note that broadcast domains help with security, so you want your servers on their own broadcast domain. not sure what else we can do to do better at nect tbh, i think the topology part is just free marks compared to the cloud parts

ask your lecturer?
