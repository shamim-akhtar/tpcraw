Comment by Upper_Yak_2856: Yeah the school wifi wasn't working during that time; shld be working now.

Comment by ilovetehc: yea i tried tht several times but it still doesnt work :(

Comment by NyandaKun: Can I ask which area is the WiFi being affected ?

Comment by ilovetehc: i use my laptop in the engineering block and library , the wifi doesnt work at both areas ,, but the wifi still works on my phone tho , does it have smt to do w my laptop instead ?

Comment by NyandaKun: Not necessarily to do with your laptop fault . Based on my experience in that issue , what I do is that I would check the WiFi on why is it unable to give me connection, is it because I need to re log in . If attempt to re log in and unable to receive connection, meaning I would restart the laptop just to reboot the system .

Comment by ilovetehc: i did all that already and restarted my laptop too , still doesnt work , unfortunately :( it connects fine with my hotspot data but it just has problems with the sch wifi ..
ive tried to :
forget the wifi n re login
1.restart my laptop
2.troubleshoot the problem in settings
3.forget the wifi n shut down my laptop n power it on awhile after and re connect ,,
but it still doesnt work ðŸ˜ž i think it might just be my laptop atp ,,

Comment by NyandaKun: Can you try this ? I am not a tech expert but I found this in google . And also please do with caution .
