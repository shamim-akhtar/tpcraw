Comment by nothappygooutside: all TP sports CCAs require experience to get in. its very competitive to get in because a lot of people want the CCA but not everyone can pass the trials. and yes, it's pretty high commitment because training usually starts at 6pm and can end as late as 11pm. you may also be called to come for training during term and semester breaks

Comment by nothappygooutside: TP sports club is a good alternative for those who do not have experience in a specific sport :)
