Comment by Why_salty69: Depends on ur CP. That module just gives extra time for ur CP to settle stuff within ur class

Comment by NyandaKun: CP Hour is just mainly some admin stuff within your class. So basically nothing much for CP Hour unless your care person has something to inform your class.

Comment by coochie_destroya: my CP always let us take off on Friday so we donâ€™t need go school for just that 1 lesson ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°

Comment by Altruistic_Hand3617: Yea it depends on your CP. I havenâ€™t met mine physically after the y1s1 cuz he just doesnâ€™t want to have them and no one complains. Prolly only had CP hour around 7 times in 3 years

Comment by MathematicianLoud947: CP hour is just once a month. Not every week

Comment by blackrosethorn3: My cp was quite strict so like only 5 ppl show up on the last day x.x
