Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: Nope, you hit the cop so you can definitely put it as your first choice.
I would advise you to check out the updated cop if any on 2025.

Comment by SensitiveMail6714: ohh but the cop given atm is based off last yearâ€™s one i think

Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: Then you're good, you would likely be in the first choice. Congratulations

Comment by SensitiveMail6714: what are the chances of the cop dropping this year? bc i saw that it dropped last yr too

Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: We don't know, low chance?. Even if it changes it would be a point diff. So just apply for it,  you're definitely in a good hand. Maybe put your 2nd and 3rd choice as a safety net too. You don't want to get a course that doesn't interest you at worst.

Comment by SensitiveMail6714: ohh alright thankss!

Comment by Valuable_Image1098: hii can ask did u end up getting it?
