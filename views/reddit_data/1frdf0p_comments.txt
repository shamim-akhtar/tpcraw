Comment by scams-are-everywhere: It only starts being important once you have a good cgpa

Comment by theuselessmastermind: 1. more for resume & portfolio 
2. more important to have significance in points like competition but there is a minimum total (don't recall how many but it's in double digits). still not as important as cgpa
3. no. it might affect ur chances of being exco ig? some ccas want someone with experience in it but for the most part it doesn't matter

Comment by W4773N: 1. More towards portfolio
2. What is more important is your CGPA, as university look out for CGPA more than SEAL points. For SEAL points, you definitely will get service seal points when you do CCN day & LEADACT and enrichment SEAL points by signing up for events which u can check ur outlook. From point 3, if u do get a main comm role, you’ll easily get 20 SEAL points under leadership, and also more SEAL points under service if the CCA you’re main comm in let’s you organise events. And if you are a class rep, that’s another 20 SEAL points under leadership. 
3. Nothing much to worry as you can join a CCA whenever you like, whether in Y1, Y2 or even Y3. Though if you are looking for main comm roles you might be at a slight disadvantage as for some CCA u need to be in the CCA for one year, that means u would have a chance to be a main comm only in Y3, but in Y3 u’re likely to be busy cuz of MP and SIP.

Comment by Necessary_Song1056: is poly that hard that we have to consider not taking cca ?

Comment by Harold_Throckmorton: simply put, No

Comment by Character_Algae_8280: It depends, I knew people who were excelling in secondary school struggle to keep up with a 3+ gpa. Poly is just a different environment that you need to adapt to.
