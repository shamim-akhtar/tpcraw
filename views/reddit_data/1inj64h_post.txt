Body: I got my enrollment email. I am a pr and its given me a option to apply for tution grant which sounds great. But it says I need to work in Singapore for 3 years after graduation.

Does this mean for my internship in year 3 I cant work overseas and when I graduate I probably need to go ns so does it continue after ns
