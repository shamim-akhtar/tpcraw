Comment by SuitFinancial2209: fail even by 1 mark in pfp = gg

on politemall under each subject there should be something showing the weightage of all the things you've done over the semester like term test, class part, etc

just take a look at that, then add up all the percentages you've got so far and use that as a rough estimation of how many marks you need to score for the sem test

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Ex pfp student. Math finals are easier than term test just saying. 2 hours is a lot of time to think so just fully utilize it. My term test was a B and Final was a high A
