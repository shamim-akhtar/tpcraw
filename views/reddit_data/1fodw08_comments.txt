Comment by Zealousideal-War4092: Hi OP, coming from a y2 poly student in dip of biz. Firs t point, yes absolutely include ur participation in ur competitions. It shows to the board that you have commitment to ur CCA which is one component they are quite keen about(commitment). 

However, your O lvl subjects and edusave award will not be taken into consideration as they have happened in secondary school and are no longer valid in their eyes(similar to how you cant use pri sch CCA records when you EAE). I hope this helps and all the best for your application
