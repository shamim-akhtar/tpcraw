Comment by MusicianEffective244: Some of us wrote a report to Mr Tan Hong Yap to provide a feedback regarding the test. My invigilator was disruptive the entire time & did not give us a proper clock to refer to. A lot of the marking scheme and stuff were clearly vague.

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Apparently there isn’t any… teaching team doesn’t practice moderation or bell curve in TP especially… not sure how this will play out

Comment by Braydentann: How much did you score bro?

Comment by IndependentNo6105: my invigilator told us to screenshot lockdown browser wtf

Comment by AtomZones: i literally raised my hand for the invigilator to show us the timing, then she was like ' u no watch ah '

Comment by dmgfwafja: I finished it but didnt have time to test it 😐😐

Comment by IndependentNo6105: python q2 asked us to basically create an airport-like system where u have the interface for 6 options (i forgot them already) and theres so many loops and functions in there its basically undoable in what little time we have after doing python q1 and mcqs (roughly 1 hour left on average) q2 itself is like 100+ lines at least

personally when the cher just said 5 minutes left i highkey gave up alr bc wtf was even going on

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: ya omg so little time to learn about it & they expected us to code a whole game interface 😁

Comment by kaedemiyata: this is cap, have one -graduated senior

Comment by Latter_Special655: didnt do well bro i got a c im just glad i passed the mod sia

Comment by lostclip: Also him: go and ask another invigilator why student cannot screenshot lockdown browser. 

Other invigilator: don't need screenshot, just need to show the submission page

Him after the invigilator left: Please screenshot the lockdown browser 🤦🏻‍♀️

Comment by MusicianEffective244: WHAT

Comment by IndependentNo6105: mine didnt even make it past the menu page cooked am i

Comment by IndependentNo6105: also the thing hangs like crazy and from what ive heard sometimes it basically removes our answers so thats cool

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: damn wtf is thatttt sounds difficult okok thanks anyways

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Heng ah..

Comment by kaedemiyata: for my course cyber right, there was this ethical hacking module, think there were two tests and my class 90% failed (includ. me) but i still ended with C+

Comment by MusicianEffective244: This exact thing happened for CYFUN test. I can confidently say 90% of students in the cohort failed badly and they even showed our grade at the end of the test. Hoping the bell curve will activate for this
