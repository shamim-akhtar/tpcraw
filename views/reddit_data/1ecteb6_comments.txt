Comment by Successful_Bear276: Hi, it's okay if you do not have any experience with airplane modules and technology achievements to use for your portfolio. I can provide you with some questions to guide you in making your portfolio:
1. Why would you choose this course?
2. What experiences do you have related to this course? (Does not have to be theory or whatsoever, it can be like your hobby is planespotting etc.)
3. What do you hope to achieve?
4. What achievements do you have that can showcase the uniqueness of yourself?

Of course, many questions can be asked to help you build a good portfolio. Try your best to make the portfolio a good representation of who you are, and your aspirations!


To answer your second question, yes body language is vital no matter it is an interview or not. Body language and dressing are usually the determiner of how one would treat you afterwards, as it is a first impression. Confidence is key when answering questions, but don't be over-confident.
And to be honest, no matter your actions, you will be judged. So, be mindful!

If I am right, the interviews are online in small groups so you do not have to worry too much about your body language. Just make sure you present yourself that can leave a good and positive impression on others.

P.S. What is your group number!

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: What if i dont have experiences or hobbies like planespotting? , can i say ive watched alot of airplanes related films? Or went to museum to see them? Or seen different airplanes in the airport?

Comment by Successful_Bear276: Yep, that's totally relevant. Just be sure that you can cite some of your claims with evidence such as oh I watch __________ on __________. And what did I find interesting in the mueseum about _____________ is that _______. Yeah, so just try to make a link and show that you're not lying. That's it.

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: Sorry to ask but what if i hadnt been watching shows on them

Comment by Successful_Bear276: Try to recall if you have any experiences related to aviation. You can use those experiences to back up.

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: Thank you
