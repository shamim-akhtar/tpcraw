Comment by pokkagreentea100: hi, please refer to the announcement with the title ' SEMESTRAL EXAMINATION NOTICE [24 Feb (Mon) - 7 Mar 2025 (Fri)]' , you have to scroll down a bit. 

to find the exam results release date you scroll all the way below under the section 'Release of Examination Results' in the announcement post.
