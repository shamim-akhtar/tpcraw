Comment by NyandaKun: If you never visited the dalgona stall, itâ€™s literally very novel / innovative . Cause selling Dalgona in Singapore is very hard because of the technique + the trend of Dalgona candy in Singapore is hard to get unless people can relate e.g. squid game .

Comment by DeluluMuffinHead: I think the squid game guard was quite cute, just waving at everyone

Comment by NyandaKun: And I bought like 4 Dalgona candy for like $15 . Worth it .
