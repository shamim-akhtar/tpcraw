Comment by vvansjx: I'm from AEG. If u have taken amath in ur secondary school, eng math should be easy for you! Not same course as you but to help you ease your mind, my lecturers are really nice. I can see some really trying their best to help the students! My advice would be try to enjoy your life in poly as much as possible, I recently started working and I miss those time alot

Comment by Fearless_Sky1016: hii im hoping to join cep to get into bze. i dont take amath, will i be at a disadvantage?

Comment by Reeeleleve: No, there are supplementary lessons and LSP (learning support program) programs to help you in Math or subjects you are weak in. Honestly, Engineering Math 1 isn’t too hard. Just got to be consistent and practice.
