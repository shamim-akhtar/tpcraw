Body: idk why on specifically wednesday mornings this whole semester ive been feeling rly sick but like, only in the morning. So cos of that i was just stuck at home for an hour plus but i still wanted to go class right, then my dumbass never thought to get mc, so now ive got a ngp for a 4CU module. Is there a way to try and appeal?
