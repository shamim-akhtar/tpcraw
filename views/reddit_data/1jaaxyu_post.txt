Body: Hi everyone, I’m enrolled in the April 2025 batch for Part-Time Diploma in Legal Executive Studies. The email I received mentioned that those who have paid their course fees should get their enrolment package and course timetable by **24 March 2025**. I know it’s still a bit early, but I was just wondering if anyone has received theirs yet?

Would appreciate any updates! Thanks!
