Comment by pawsies7rae18: I'm also a  y1 but not in iit..tbh like every course has its difficulty n nothing comes easy. Learn IT is such a good thing in tdy's world. If you're looking to earn good $$ when u graduate iit is for u..but if want to follow your passion perhaps n forgo the $$ then that's another option!

Comment by jasminebubblegum: for most of your projects, you can just improve from the labs you do and you can at least get a pass. you arent stupid dw abt it bc im in y2 and i still have no idea what im doing too😇🙏

Comment by MathematicianLoud947: The reality is that most of your classmates are bad at coding. Real coding. Most would fail a real quiz or exam, or projects where they can't get code online or from Chat GPT.

You need to: 

Pay attention in class, and do your practical work diligently. Don't sleep, stare at the ceiling, text your friends, watch videos, or whatever. If you don't have enough self discipline, put your phone in your bag and keep it there.

Ask your tutor when you don't understand something, and use Chat GPT to explain concepts (not give you answers!). You can ask Chat GPT for code, but make sure you get it to explain and comment the code, then ask you questions about it afterwards.

Don't ask your friends for answers or code. Try to figure things out for yourself. The final code isn't really so important. It's the figuring out that matters (that will eventually translate to better grades) 

Make sure you understand all the basic concepts: variables, variable scope, data types, control structures (if, for, while), functions, data structures (arrays, lists), core OOP concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, etc.), and so on. 

Take it seriously. Don't spend all of your "free" time playing games or doom-scrolling.

Don't think of learning as a chore. Be thankful that you live such a privileged life (compared to most people in other countries) that you can spend three years learning at a world class educational institute.

Borrow a textbook from the library. Textbooks tend to lead you in a structured way, so you'll have more guidance than with fragmented web pages. If you really can't read, find a reputable YouTube playlist that starts from the basics to more complex concepts.

Don't expect it to be easy! As I said, most of your classmates aren't as good as you think they are, whatever their grades (though a few will be).

Work hard!

Don't give up.

Eventually it will click and start to be fun.

Comment by SGSweatZ: bro in also in IIT y1 and suffering also. i didnt even finish the COMT exam, the entire last coding question blank lol, im fucking cooked to the bone. I hope we both make it bro

Comment by Foreign_Dirt_6966: NAWWW this is so real bc im y1 iit too and WYM ppl actually got to the second big code qn in comt exam….. lowk i get you bc im lagging behind so hard and im DEFO not the 🤓🤓🤓☝️☝️☝️☝️ type so ‼️ gg i think we have no choice but to familiarise ourselves w coding on a regular basis to pick it up as naturally as the others 😕👎

Comment by pawsies7rae18: Everything requires hard work n just press on tbh. I also felt really at lost in sem 1 but all my seniors also say the same thing..so don't think u shld worry!!

Comment by kaedemiyata: wkwkwkwkw i felt the same as u when i was in poly cos theres always those worldskills 🤓👆 ppl but i still managed to cruise by with 3.5gpa, eventually ull understand la but still put in some effort to go find out, and ya def got some ppl is more talented in coding and all that but i think if u put in the work to learn then itll all be fine

plus ur father is right, tech starting pay lowest abt 5k now, business even u grad nus or what also 3k only do marketing in sme

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: gg ur cooked

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Hi! Y1 IIT common ICT as well.

Comment by usermanokok55: Hey, was from TP IIT as well. 

I gotta admit, it seems like you guys are getting it harder from the time I graduated (2 years back) and now. 

COMT was just us building an android app 😂

But anyway, what I would wanna say is to do well in tech (or perhaps anything hands on) is just to practice, practice practice. You gotta do it till it becomes muscle memory for you to truly do well. 

You can think of programming/coding as learning an actual new language like Chinese Malay etc. And definitely the process is tough. But after you’ve been in here for some time, it’ll definitely ease in and be easier

Do not beat yourself up for the first semester. My Y1S1 results were the worst across my semesters. Take it as a learning point, and do well for the next. 

Perhaps what you can do is to really give yourself a headstart by reading up what you’ll be doing next semester during the holidays. For example, if you’re doing web dev next sem, you can look at HTML/CSS/JS from websites like w3schools. 

The learning process may be slower, but what matters is that we are patient with it. Spend some time everyday after class to program, and slowly you’ll be able to get it. All the best!
