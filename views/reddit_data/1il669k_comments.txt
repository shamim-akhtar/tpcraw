Comment by iamnothingbuta: Get a gaming laptop

Comment by pokkagreentea100: To be honest a normal laptop is fine.

I would usually advice to not bring gaming laptops as it's heavier.

Comment by BudgetDevv: I personally prefer a productive laptop over a gaming one. Good number of gaming laptops are bulky and have poor build quality. Battery life may also be important depending on which school you're from ( IIRC BUS school lacked charging outlets ). 

Though, I am also sort of biased since I have a desktop for gaming ( I assume most get a gaming laptop in order to game on it as well )

Comment by ApocSanma: Idk but im bringing a gaming laptop legion i5 if it helps

Comment by MathematicianLoud947: Which diploma?

Comment by Forward_Age6095: okay I will probably get a lenovo LOQ laptop. any objections or is this good?

Comment by Current-Material-339: Gaming Laptop, to play games at school, during classes?

Comment by Forward_Age6095: lenovo legion, hp victus or asus tuf?

Comment by Forward_Age6095: nah cuz i need a dedicated graphics card and gaming laptops are cheaper than getting normal laptops with dedicated graphics

Comment by iamnothingbuta: tbf not sure but seen a lot of people complaining about tuf build quality, i am using rog laptop which is fine but quite ex, not sure about victus but legion is quite popular, your course also looks like you are doing very heavy gpu or cpu work so better to see which option you want, but best if you get one with a lot of space too

Comment by Glad-Lynx-5007: Legion

Comment by Current-Material-339: It's a good idea to consider purchasing from HP, Lenovo, or Acer. However, I recommend steering clear of MSI.
