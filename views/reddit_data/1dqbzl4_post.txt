Body: for context i'm a Y1 student studying IT. as far as my resume goes, i don't really have a lot to show as a IT student (a few prototypes of UI/UX and 3 hackathons as a participant) so i feel like i wouldn't be offered an internship anyways.

 i only have COMT and LOMA left for tests which will be done by first 2 weeks of august then i have holidays until october. 

im currently deciding against just working a full time job or applying for internships for 3 months (and if anyone has any company they could point me too would be helpful 🙏🏻) IT seniors pls comment ur own experience if you have taken internships before your mandated poly internship thank you!!!
