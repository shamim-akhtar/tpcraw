Comment by GlasierXplor: You do have to write reports throughout your 3 years so English is still important somewhat.. even if you have good content, bad grammar can make the content lose it's meaning.



if you really want to improve without affecting your GPA, find a short course like English for Business or something. No shame in wanting to be better lol

Comment by meowzy19: can just use AI (grammar checker etc.) for writing lor

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: what course?

Comment by mount2010: If you are doing PFP you probably will have English, not from PFP so can't comment. Otherwise poly courses don't really care/focus directly on English anymore. But TP has "TPFun" general education courses with essay writing required sometimes so you still need some essay writing skills.

Comment by blackrosethorn3: Y1 doesn't have English but TP has free Grammarly subscription. I suggest you use chatgpt to check ur language too

Comment by PandAMonierm: If your English isn't at least mid - as in, it really sucks - then I think you're better off taking some short courses on English. Because you'll want to at least be decent at it throughout poly and beyond.

Comment by Evening_Attorney9858: Biomedical engineering

Comment by Evening_Attorney9858: Is that counted towards your final gpa? Am doing pfp rn and just want to know who important tpfun is in calculating ur GPA

Comment by theuselessmastermind: tp has free grammarly? damn im y2 and i didnt even know that

Comment by meowzy19: if assignment do at home can use AI on phone, but if its in sch then gg but its ok can just do ur best. idt poly cares abt english , just more of ur understanding

Comment by scams-are-everywhere: All the comm mods are included in gpa

Comment by mount2010: Idk but the TPfun mods I've taken so far are just pass/fail meaning as long as you pass (easy, just do every mandatory assignment) you have nothing to worry about

Comment by definitelytroaxx: i don't think we have grammarly pro cause that time i logged in w my school account and its just the free account... correct me if im wrong though

Comment by Evening_Attorney9858: so there is no A, B, C? just pass or fail?

Comment by mount2010: yup, the TPFun modules are kind of nonsense imo so don't worry about them
