Comment by nothappygooutside: hi for ur internship they will actually send a list of companies for u to choose from. u can't choose companies from outside that list. they'll send the list in may i think, then you're given one month plus to apply to and interview with those companies

Comment by Sea-Policy1707: oh but our course head advise us to self secure internship positions. they encourage us to find companies but at the end of the day, still need the schoolâ€™s approval.

Comment by nothappygooutside: wah... maybe things changed because my information is from the a&f seniors my age HAHAHAH
