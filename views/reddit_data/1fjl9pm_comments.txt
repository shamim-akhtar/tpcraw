Comment by Due-Philosophy1389: uh where is the admin building ah

Comment by iamnothingbuta: I mean I got c+ for this but I think I should have gotten a b or b+ I don't think I messed up any components

Comment by Ok_Aerie6132: Got admin fee. I think around $30, but if really got error in marking then they will refund

Comment by BunnyGaming1: will we talk directly w the lecturer who marked our work or we just pay the fee & wait for a reply?

Comment by Ok_Aerie6132: Nope. You don't get to talk to anyone. You will only get the outcome for the appeal.

Comment by BunnyGaming1: sigh thanks

Comment by iamnothingbuta: do they take the old highest or the new highest?

Comment by iamnothingbuta: like the mark

Comment by Ok_Aerie6132: There is no highest, possible to get lower too. They take the correct marks.

Comment by iamnothingbuta: How do they check? They look at marks or look at the work again?
