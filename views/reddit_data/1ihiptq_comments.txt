Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Hii omg I love answering qns so dw about having too many qns:

1. MBT has quite a lot of MBT-oriented overseas trips actl. In 2023, the lecturers organised a trip to go bangkok: we visited the university, got to know about the experiments they do there and had a thai-sg-vietnam exchange sesh! We also visited a hospital and got to see their lab! They were analysing tissue samples etc. and I think foetal samples? (In y1 i was completely lost so half of the info went in and out whilst they were doing the guided tour 😅) Then in 2024, they organised a trip to go japan (we visited tokyo & shizuoka): we visited a hospital in shizuoka and the doctors gave us a talk on their academia & career progression etc. We also visited various agri-tech companies! There was also a trip to go korea in feb 2024, but y1s couldn’t sign up back then, only y2&3s. In 2025, they’re organising a trip to Australia (Gold coast and I think melbourne?) idk the itinerary tho + its only open to current y1-y3 MBT + PHS students > they’re going in march! For your batch will have to wait for more info.

Note that the MBT-specific trips are not subsidised so you’ll need to pay around 1-3k to the school for airplane, lodging and meals. Price differs on where the destination is.

However, if you can’t afford the MBT-specific trips, there’s always the global studies trips! Global studies is a mandatory module all the TP students need to take, you can choose to go on the trip (heavily subsidised) or to stay in sg and do the project. Its more of a take picture and reflect kinda project.

For the rest of this question: camps and festivities.. hmm Idk why but every halloween there’s always a ASC study club organising a halloween rave (im not a party goer but that has happened for both halloweens ive been in TP). For camps, you defo can’t miss Day 3 of the freshmen orientation :) It’s called regatta and its this super big event where the whole y1 cohort for all 6 schools will gather at bedok reservoir for a dragon boat race 

To be honest, most of the learning journeys, networking opportunities etc. are not served on a platter to you in TP, you need to keep an eye out for MSTeams announcements, email etc. (and TPOei) to be able to sign up for these stuff. And they’re usually quite competitive 😅 

The surest way to gain access to these announcements would be to get into TP’s LEAD Programme. Basically it’s a programme for the top 10%? (I think) of your course’s cohort and those with a main committee position in any of the CCAs. I think you can easily get into the LEAD programme by getting a gpa of 3.8+ in y1s1? Thats juz q1 omg okay wait i gotta split this lol.

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Q2. I use ipad to annotate on lecture slides! I’ll download them as pdfs and then upload them into collanote (free app) and annotate the slide while watching the lecture videos. For notes, I used to write them out, but as you progress the content gets more and more and you have less and less time to hand write everything out… so now I type out all my notes into one note! 

I still handwrite my tutorial answers on ipad tho, need to practice writing so I don’t die from hand pain during exams

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Q3. I love our MBT lecturers honestly. They’re all so passionate about their jobs and you can really tell. Be keen, ask good questions and get along with them! They’re all really sweet people and they won’t hesitate to answer your questions if you have any! Some lecturers are a bit yappy but thats about it I think!

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: 4. Oohh good question. To be honest? For my batch, there was quite a bit of knowledge gap and workload gap between y1 and y2. You really needed to read up a lot (through reference text provided, googling & chatgpt-ing) and questions were really less of memorisation and more of application for some modules. For those that still required intense memorisation? The content was ginormous. I frankly died. (Laughs in 500 slides for term test 1 in y2s2) But issok im holding on and alive. I’m not too sure about your batch tho, cause I think the y1 syllabus changes every year… (for e.g. the batch before mine, digitalisation in applied science was graded, then in my batch it was pass/fail and this time around it’s graded again…)

5. Adding on to my answer in question 4, I think my y1 timetable was more chill, less classes started at 9am. These past 2 semesters while I have a few days off, most of the days I have class at 9am. Timetable is a little difficult to answer as it really differs from person to person.

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: 6. Hmm I’m assuming when you say lab you mean like our lab lessons. The max hours I’ve had in lab for a singular module was 4h. But also depends on your timetable cause they can put 2 back to back lab sessions that can add up to be about max 8h. But they’ll probably give breaks if the content isn’t too heavy. 

Oh but I’ve had a module where the lab session overran by 1h before. So 3h lab turned into 4h (supposed to end at 6pm but ended at 7pm instead)

Ah whilst I’m on the topic of lab, back to q1, ASC has this programme where you can sign up to take up ongoing research projects during the semestral breaks! Each project usually takes in about 2-3 students so it can get quite competitive 

Edit: oops missed out the part about how much of the lab is graded.. uhh depends from module to module but around 30-40%?? Like some modules there’ll be lab tests worth 20% each where your laboratory skills and basic lab math is tested (microscopy, staining, cell count are some tests I can think of) then alongside those tests some modules, as mentioned earlier, have this project which spans across multiple months/weeks where you perform the experiment, record the results then submit a report that’s also graded. (But for these the results don’t really matter, more of your analytical skills) (these are also around 20-25% per component?)

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: 7. I think I had a lot more projects in y1 than y2. Y2 projects are more cumulative but yes we do have projects often. Usually 1 group project per module! But that group project can encompass across multiple components e.g. your slides (15%) then presentation another (15%) or something. Then sometimes they’ll throw in a group/individual report based on the experimental project you did as a group!

8. Around 20-25 ppl per class! There’s 4 MBT classes, with 1 class entirely comprised of ppl from CSP. (Pssst: Get along with people from other classes! Every class has a different timetable so sometimes other classes get to do their presentation first so you can ask them what the questions the lecturer asked!) > QNA is usually individually graded (normally 5%!)

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: 9. Hmm some advice I can offer.. Networking is key! Get along with your peers and lecturers, even those from outside of MBT! To help with networking, I recommend joining a CCA that really aligns with your interests. But if you’re aiming for a good balance between your studies & CCA, I won’t recommend a sports/arts cca cause of higher commitment levels. Also if you want a leadership position, I feel like unless you’re really good at time management, I recommend only taking a leadership position up in y3.

Whilst you’re studying, find out what you’re really passionate about. MBT has 5 electives that you can choose at the end of y2: cardio tech, clinical lab, research, pharm & manufacturing + marketing (sci products related). 

For me I got into clinical lab cause I really love handling blood samples and the analysis of these human samples are really interesting and fun for me hehe.

Sorry if my answers are soo long I’m really yappy lol

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: Why does the timetable differ person to person?

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: Damn 8h sounds brutal

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: Omg that's smart thank you

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: It's ok i rlly appreciate your answers so much I actually didn't expect such detailed answers
Hope to see you in TP!

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Sometimes ppl due to various reasons need to retake modules, and all the classes have different timetables cause there’s honestly not a lot of MBT tutors. Also some people take additional modules, bunch of reasons. But generally you’ll have the same timetable as your classmates

Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Hehe no problem!! See you in TP!

Comment by SeniorMacaroon7028: Ohh I see thank you
