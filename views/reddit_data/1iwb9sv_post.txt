Body: Hi guys im sharing y1 in april and i’d like to join CCAs to help build up my portfolios. Most likely no sports because i dont enjoy sports, unless its swimming or bowling (basically the less strenuous ones that arent in the heat….) 

Any CCA recommendations that i could join that would help build up my portfolio for uni? And i’d like to ask if a CCA that requires lesser commitment like maybe event based / once a month VS a CCA with two days a week commitment, are they both equally recognised on your portfolio?
