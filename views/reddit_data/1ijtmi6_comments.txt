Comment by Dangerous_Elk_8716: honestly, any is fine just avoid acer made the mistake of getting acer swift 3x in april 2021 (was from a business course too) july 2023 i bought a keyboard cause the keyboard started having issues already and now some keys just refuse to work need to spam it then might get reaction

also had a lot of blue screen errors at the beginning and had to factory reset after contacting them but now still will get it once in a while quite annoying tbh 

not even sure if acer is on the list now lol

hi, please refer to this website.

For business, you can buy a normal windows notebook. memory 8gb, hard drive 512gb. you can just get intel core i5 and above.
if you have any preferred notebook, you can just send me a message and I can check for you.

Comment by Frequent-Program8916: is asus zenbook alright for business?

Comment by pokkagreentea100: assuming that the storage and hard drive meets the minimum, yes it's alright.
