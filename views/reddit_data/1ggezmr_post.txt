Body: Hi, I have a friend who is currently deciding whether to take Guided Learning or Sustainbility In Action. She knows what SCA is about, but she also wants to know what is Guided Learning about. Anyone here who chose to do Guided Learning mind sharing what it is about and why she should/should not take it?
