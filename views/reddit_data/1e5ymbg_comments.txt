Comment by bugwords507: Hi, I applied eae to engineering last year as well and they actually only sent me the interview email around 25 July, so I think you might just have to wait around for now.

Comment by Successful_Bear276: I have yet to receive anything from TP too, the test was horrendous for me as I didn't complete the last few questions but still holding on to the hope that I would still be shortlisted. Don't worry, I'm sure those who have the passion and interest in the course(s) they EAEed to will shine through to the lecturers. All the best! 😊

Comment by Apprehensive-Trip667: hi i wouldnt worry about it rn last year they sent the accepted email 11 days after the aptitude test. so just wait first GL!

Comment by Successful_Bear276: Hihi, just received an email back from TP this morning for the interview! Check your inbox, hope to hear good news from you and all the best! 😁

Comment by Existing_Zucchini_62: From the people and grp chats i asked . I don't think any engineering course has sent an email yet.

Comment by None: You failed. They don’t wait that long. The moment you passed, you will hear back from them within a couple of days.
