I am y1 in CDP and I seriously want to drop out. I've thought about it thoroughly and already discussed it with my parents and care person (though my CP wants me to stay). I've emailed the school asking about the fees, which confirmed that I do not have outstanding tuition fees for the current semester, but that their colleagues will email me if there is any other outstanding other than tuition fees.

But I don't know what other fees there are, and how much it would cost. Does anyone have any ideas as to what it could be + how much it would be?
