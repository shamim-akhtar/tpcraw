Comment by junhao995: Ask your parents to apply for CPF education loan scheme through your parent CPF Account online.

As long if there is sufficient amount in your parents OA account, you no need to use GIRO to pay the rest.

You will eventually have to paid back the amount you borrow from your parent CPF after a year once you graduation.

And Good luck for your upcoming course ðŸ˜„
