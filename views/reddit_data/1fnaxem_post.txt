Body: Jus asking as the requirement for scholarship is like gpa of 3 for y1s1
Do I still have another chance if I do well for sem 2 ? Like I did really badly this sem and for next sem if I do well like a 3.5 for example will they just look at the 3.5 and not my current result? Because the descriptions for the awards they are just counting for the semester
