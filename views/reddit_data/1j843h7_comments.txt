Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Biz studies club isnt weirdâ€¦ we have it for other academic schools like design, IIT, ASC, etc haha. Tbh, stargazers was a little out of the blue as it is a newly introduced CCA.

Comment by Longjumping-Load-164: I see, I placed weird cause I heard weird stories from the Japanese club hehe, but business studies sounds quite interesting, stargazers too!
