Body: hi! So im putting marketing as my first choice but I miss the cop by 1 point so this is my second and will prolly get in here and I have a few qns

1) are the modules hard
2) what are the internship opportunities 
3) overall is the course boring bc i have a genuine interest in biz but im scared Iâ€™ll hate the engineering mods and screw up my gpa
