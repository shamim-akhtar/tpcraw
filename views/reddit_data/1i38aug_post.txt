hello so i applied for aerospace engineering at temasek poly. I have a few questions 

1) I scored 7 for L1R4 and i was wondering if i get put into the same class with ppl of the same score or is it mixed?

2) I know that engineering is all about math , physics and design . so i was wondering about what device to get . ppl said that an ipad wld be good due to the math and physics equations that u havr to do but others said that a windows laptop with a strong processor is needed for CAD and other designing software .

3) How is the overall teaching in the course . like are all the lecturers really enthusiastic and understanding. Are the resources like notes and slides good?

4) btw from what i know , ppl have warned me about going to poly just due to the fact abt group work. many have said that a major reason for a decrease in GPA is because of ppl who are too lazy to do any work in the group and bring down others . is that a case for aerospace engineering 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING AND ANSWERINGüôèüôèüôè
