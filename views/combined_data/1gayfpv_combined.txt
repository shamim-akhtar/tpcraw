Body: Hello. My name is Leo Guo, and I am pursuing a diploma in product experience and design. I am currently completing my final year project at Temasek Polytechnic. The purpose of this survey is to understand the future culture of the elderly so that it can cater to and adapt to the population in Singapore

By 2030, 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be 65 years old and above. There will be a culture shift, especially in how people want to prevent severe health risks such as vascular diseases, cognitive declination, and mobility issues. How can we enhance preventive healthcare and empower pre-seniors to take their healthcare crucially so they can age gracefully?

Your insight is valuable to me and it will take 10-15 minutes!
