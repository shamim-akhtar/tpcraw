Comment by iamnothingbuta: Html and js for adev, sql for the data base thingy, dsag uses python and nect uses some cisco learner lab thing

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: sem 2 is chill asf

Comment by Latter_Special655: sem 2 is relatively more chill its the best time out of my 1.5 yrs in poly(as of now), i think its also cos they combined like 2 modules assignment into 1 so like u dun need so rush so much assignments, thrs pros and cons tho, if u r good at it u will do well for both modules if u r bad u will do badly for both modules, but adev and the other one i cant rmb the name is javascript, dsag will continue on python then network will continue on aws

Comment by Baxtonwarls: Not from commonict but all IT courses are the same in year one. For sem 2 there’s one less subject but the ADEV project will be tough and take up a lot of time. With sufficient effort and A is attainable for all of the subjects and in my oppinion was way easier than the first sem but it’s much more code based

Comment by CornerDry1533: TP IT Alumni here. yr 1 is pretty chill. most of the courses are the same across all courses, but that being said. chill doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels. try to get as high as possible now. later into the course (Y2 S2, Y3) things will get faster and tougher bahaha

Comment by Baxtonwarls: If you have time, you’ll get a rlly good headstart for the AWS subject by studying for cloud practitioner AWS exam in the 6week break. I did my cloud practitioner and year1sem2 and year2sem1 both had AWS and it was all incredibly easy while most ppl were struggling. Go on Udemy or YouTube and search “study cloud practitioner” you’ll get your resources required. 2 hours a day for a month and you’ve secured a A for two subjects for the next two sems

Edit: I’m from Big data, and for us year2 sem 1 also has a AWS subject, but I’m not sure if thatlll be the case for the common ict course. Anyways still reccoment studying for cloud practitioner exam

Comment by Baxtonwarls: Bought a course on Udemy. Taught me everything I needed to know. Passed the test really easily on the first try.
