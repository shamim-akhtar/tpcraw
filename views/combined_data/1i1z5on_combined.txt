Body: Hello everyone reading this! Are you from IIT Year 1?  (or just IIT in general?) Are you unsatisfied with the current semester and feel certain topics (ADEV/DBAV, NECT) are rushed and poorly planned? 

I would like to extend a formal invitation to everyone affected by these course grievances to  come have a discussion about what to write for our course feedback in Tessy! I want to gather as many people as possible to send a set of feedback that is consistent among multiple classes and students!

I believe that if a large majority of people across the level submit feedback that is both consistent and accurate, the course chairs and organisers will have a very difficult time ignoring it and will at least take some time to think and review how their courses are organised.

This has been concluded, thanks to everyone who participated! Hopefully, this made an impact.

Comment by None: wouldnt a google form be better ?

Comment by gunJOusts: If I were just collecting the feedback yeah, but I want to then collate it and then make a sort of template for how we write our Tessy feedbacks later. An organised act like this is hard to go unnoticed.

Comment by None: well hopefully people contribute

Comment by gunJOusts: Here's to hoping! You can help too by spreading the word or joining if you're an IIT student.
