Comment by mount2010: They really should make a website/info page about this, there's literally no information about the gym at all or some places around the campus (e.g. study areas)

Honestly TP's online information is a mess in general, I hope they spend money on a website redesign

Comment by definitelytroaxx: yes open 1030am - 330pm
