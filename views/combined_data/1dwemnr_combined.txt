Body: Hello, I applied for eae under the ite student side for aviation management course. Have not received any aptitude test or whatsoever. Should I be concerned about it?

Comment by AQiQimain: Can't say for sure because my friend who applied for AM got their email yesterday. They are O lvl stream tho. Note that if ur not shortlisted, they wouldn't tell you.

Comment by SJ-JUSTICE: Same here, did they ever mention the date of when they would stop issuing out emails? Does it take time or is it more or less a week after?

Comment by Apprehensive-Trip667: hi from what i know most people that applied for aviation management from o level have already gotten a reply to go for their aptitude test idk if ite has a different email timing then o level tho

Comment by LividOrdinary9644: yea same. i seen a lot of people saying they got their emails but most of them are O levels. actually panicking rn

Comment by Applego12345: Shag man, if you are not shortlisted, they wouldn't email you or anything. I think I will just monitor my email for this week.

Comment by SJ-JUSTICE: I just received mine! I think for design and humans school applications you get the email this week. Hope you get yours too!

Comment by Applego12345: What course did u apply for?

Comment by SJ-JUSTICE: Digital Film and Television. Praying i get in as ive been eyeing it for years
