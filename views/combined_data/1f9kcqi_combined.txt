Body: i just received my bursary and got half of what i am supposed to receive so since the tp website said that the bursary is disbursed in 2 tranches does that mean i'll only get 1/2 of what i'm supposed to get and the remaining will come next sem? kinda confused right noww does anyone know?

Comment by strwberri111: yea shld be, so uâ€™ll get half of the amount first and the other half in the later part of the sem. (Not sure when, but I suspect around dec - jan ?)

Comment by theuselessmastermind: yep! theyre doing this so people don't spend all the money right away
