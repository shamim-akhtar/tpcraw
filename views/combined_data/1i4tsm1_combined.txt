Body: to the asc y2 and y3 students, how did u guys manage to get through y1 sem 2 (specifically the last term)? there is so much unnecessary group projects and assignments which im sure yall have done in y1 as well, on top of that, term test 2 contents are SO HEAVY for modules like nuh and cbb :’) (cbb’s slides are TERRIBLE i barely understand anything) since the term is ending soon, are there any advice or tips yall can give to us y1 asc kids who are currently struggling to cope w school rn😭😭😭 i know time will eventually pass and itll all be over soon but idk, i just feel like theres wayyyyyy too much to learn and keep up with at the moment :]

also another question, whats the workload (assignments, group projects, module contents) in y2 like? are they more worse and difficult compared to y1 or are they roughly about the same? thank u in advance!🙂‍↔️

Comment by strwberri111: LMFAOO heavy on cbb slides LOLOL.. also im so sorry to break the news to u & not to scare u but y2 gets much more worse, the content gets much more heavier & workload too, everything feels b2b, assignments, grp project, skill test (i think in general, y2 is much more difficult compared to other years, bcs on the other hand, y3 heavily relies on internship to pull up ur gpa.) 

tbh how most ppl get thru it, is knowing which tasks to put priorities first esp those that due first. If u have grp projs, try ur best to make sure ur teammates do their work (if they are able to get it done much more quicker, it will be good bcs u can spend more time revising). Everyday, make sure to at least try study for 30 mins, being it making notes/rewatching recorded tut vids etc bc trust, it’ll definitely help rather than trying to cramp everyt the week before term test. If you have multiple projs assign, try to get some parts done first in the diff projs. 

also!!! i rely on ytb for understanding certain concepts like Khan academy, Organic chem tutor.. their teaching style may be helpful and simpler to understand the content! atb!! jiayou u can do it🙏🙏

Comment by NyandaKun: Hi there, i understand how you feel. For projects and assignment TPFUN subjects like  Ecom or Global Studies , it’s manageable as long as you attend to class every day and follow along with your lecturers on what to do . 

But for projects that takes your time most of the time like NUH and INNOVA project right , i guess one way to deal with it is to organize a meeting with your group to work on the project progressively . 

For core modules, I wrote my own notes for NuH and CBB and sometimes I just copy and paste some slides into my notes and just annotate them. For stats, I just use excel to help me with my calculation and just apply my learnings from there .

Comment by Warm-Donut2570: Omgggg it gets tougher?? Gotta adapt then! Thanks for the tips!

Comment by NyandaKun: For year 2 workload, personally for mine in FNC, I would say the workload for semester 1 is okay but the commitment to the modules like baking and culinary technology is DRAINING , 2 days every week. Currently this semester, the commitment is so much that I keep thinking about the project . And plus I only have like 2 days to study for a particular module just to pass the test.
