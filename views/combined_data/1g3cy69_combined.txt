Body: Hi, I think I lost my wallet. I don't know where exactly it could have dropped, however I spent most of my time today in the IIT block, at 03-05-55. 

My wallet is long and black, with polaroids and photo strips. It has my NRIC, my poly ezlink and my sec school ezlink card. 

If anyone has seen it, (or can help me check the classroom) for it, I would really appreciate it, thank you

Comment by AtomZones: I recall someone saying there was a wallet at the toilet there, might be yours?

Comment by hollowfurnace: Hope you have already reported the loss of your NRIC

Comment by Aiyoowafap: Really? Do you know where and if they did anything with it?

Comment by AtomZones: wait mb, he said it was a phone, not a wallet, but u able to check with the office or a staff, someone might have given it to them
