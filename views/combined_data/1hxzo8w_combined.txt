Body: failed my MST and i'm struggling to understand what is happening, lecturer encouraged to go for a retest since the marks are really low (expected ngl) 

i have no friends in class and honestly don't know who to seek help from to get a better understanding of econsðŸ˜­ (would really help if anyone could share their econs notes / tips on studying it)

Comment by nothappygooutside: hello! i got distinction for econs back in y1, with 48/50 for my MST. which area are you struggling with? at MST stage, the supply-demand graphs are relatively easy. after MST the lines start getting crazy and it took me some time to understand the graph as well, so it's really important for you to grasp the fundamental concepts as it's gonna get more confusing and the only way you can understand the future concepts is by understanding the fundamental concepts

Comment by nothappygooutside: first you need to find out which area of business econs you're struggling with, i doubt you dont actually understand NOTHING, there must be some things like the concept of supply and demand and the central economic problem which you do have understanding over but you struggle to link all these concepts together
