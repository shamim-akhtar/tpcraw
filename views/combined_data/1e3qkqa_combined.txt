Body: y2 psych here (again), my friend's group needs participants for a study they are conducting on Wednesday 3-6pm at the library though it won't take very long (max30mins). currently they have ~10/40 people but if you're free please do come down for a short while to do it, there's a chance they will give you some goodies after you're done! 

if you can please comment or message me and i'll send you their Microsoft forms registration survey üôè
