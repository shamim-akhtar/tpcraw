Comment by No_Astronomer2047: there are so many scholarships you can apply for, try to find them and donâ€™t miss out especially with a 4.0 gpa and a cca, youâ€™re definitely going to get it!  i applied for TP scholarship in y1 and itâ€™s so worth it. but at that point of time, my gpa was 3.8 but i didnâ€™t have a cca and i still got selected so you definitely will be a good candidate! good luck!

Comment by Gumi_Kitteh: Check brightspark website, need a lot of data entry in your profile though.. it's like a one-stop site for most scholarships with criterias listed out, don't stuck your eye to ur poly scholarship only

Comment by W4773N: If uw to try TP scholarship, u shld go for it now cuz u can only apply for it during y1
