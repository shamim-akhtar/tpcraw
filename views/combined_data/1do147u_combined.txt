Comment by Fancy_Coffee7767: it works like a round robin, there are multiple exercises/sports and each class will rotate after 3 weeks.

Comment by theuselessmastermind: the whole class will need to vote on their top 3 and then hope you get it as one of your sports. so hope your class also wants it, if it's available

Comment by nevergiveup381: Sports and wellness is a compulsory module for all y1s unless exempted. The module takes place only in sem 1 and each class is to pick 3 sports they want to play. Each sport will last 3 lessons (3 weeks) (less if clash with holiday). And yes it is vv similar to sec sch pe except they teach u every sport from the basics. (Like for badminton theyll teach u how to hold a racket, how to serve and how to juggle the shuttlecock). As for ur senior, he prob skipped too many lessons which led him to fail that module so he had to retake in y2.

Comment by Early_Pirate4708: Cool i see thank u

Comment by Fancy_Coffee7767: um there is a planned schedule, just that each class rotates
