Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: Take turns yes, similar to F2F
Then maybe coming out with a question and expect an answer from you guys. Like real life problems maybe. 
Introduction? 
Why do you want to join this course?
Why do you think you should be picked over others?
What do you know about this course?
Can you share more about your personal experience? [ questions in your portfolio /related experience to the course]

But you should be knowledgeable on the course you want to EAE to.  Around 3-5 people in the group.

Comment by zoedian: Try to answer fast and to the point when they open questions to the floor

Comment by Successful_Bear276: Asking why they should pick you over others in a group interview is like a slap to your face ðŸ˜¨

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: Okay

Comment by Successful_Bear276: But I would say don't always be the first one to jump into answering questions!

Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: I mean they might ask something like that, why should they pick you for this course or why are you suitable for this course... Sorry for my bad English

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: Will they ask us thatt??

Comment by Successful_Bear276: Nah all good man.

Comment by Old_Nectarine_1414: Yes, I went through those interviews. The most common question is
1. Can you introduce yourself?
2. Do you have any related experience to the course?
3. questions about your portfolio or things you shared in Q1/2. Elaborate more?
4. Why is this course your 2nd/3rd choice?
5.why do you want to join this course?

Technically they're trying to see if you fit in the course, you should have general knowledge about the course. Please don't say something that you are unclear of. Please know that it might not always be these questions. Just for your references.
