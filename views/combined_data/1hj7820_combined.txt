Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: Damn 😐

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: 😔

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647:  I figured myself out already, now I have to figure out how to enjoy life other than with myself 

(after a point it's jus depressing to be by urself 24/7)

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: 😐

Comment by mount2010: i am the most fortunate person on earth and always fall ill in time for vacations

there goes any hope of self improvement when i actually have time

Comment by everything_is_stup1d: isok op you arent alone😔 我可以跟你讲话 LOL

Comment by 32Shane: What are ur hobbies or things u like doing

Comment by Prestigious_Rock_923: I understand. I just moved here few months ago. No friends. You can always go out to places you like and just talk to people. 2 out of 10 times you'll probably make a friend out of them.

Comment by Prestigious_Rock_923: I'll be your friend. Send me a message.

Comment by Berrybarrel: Ive just been working part time and doing some other random stuff that isnt really all that fulfilling

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: We have all been there at some point 😔

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: Photography, writing poems, gym, movies

I like to go out
I love food
I like company 
And to jus explore and hangout 
😁

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: Same here, doing part time and other stuff but jus feel like I have no actual life outside of that. Going out by myself jus feels depressing man

Comment by 32Shane: These are good hobbies. But all of them are solo activities. Maybe can try adding hobbies that involve others like team sports, martial arts class, dance class, etc. Where u can meet other people who alr have same interest as you

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: I've tried sports, not really gud at it so I jus end up playing but no one passing or even acknowledging my presence. Don't got money for classes. But yea thanks for tryna help I'll try ur suggestions

Comment by 32Shane: Oh I understand now. At least you're taking action and trying to make new friends. You're a positive guy dude, you'll find some friends soon.

Comment by Adventurous-Bus-647: Thanks man😊
