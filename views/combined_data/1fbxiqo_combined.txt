Comment by IndependentNo6105: brother i did, alice hartono just said the system recorded it based on submission date, hence submitting late is also considered unsubmitted

Comment by MusicianEffective244: Ohhh no wonder.. well from what Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s only possible to switch courses in ur school and not switch schools :(
