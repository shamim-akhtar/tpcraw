Comment by XxSxepticalxX: Yea they are for all students take global studies which is a tp fundamental subject, but this overseas thing is first come first serve so gotta be quick to register

Comment by None: oooh!! can i ask what year this is in?

Comment by mount2010: At the end of year 1 they'll hold a briefing about it. It'll be at the start of year 2.
If you get into TPLEAD (tp leadership programme) you will also get opportunities to go overseas as an elective.

Comment by Why_salty69: Depends on ur course. If u take global studies for y1.2 then youll have the opportunity to go overseas during that period. Otherwise itll be y2.1
