Comment by No_Orange_4342: only tpfun subjects i think cuz i only got warning letter from s&w

Comment by Due-Philosophy1389: U will get a letter on ur outlook I think only for tp fundamentals because after my first time they sent me but itâ€™s not a warning letter per say itâ€™s just a notification for u to know 
A warning letter is only issued after u skip a total of 5 times and theyâ€™ll send to ur parents cp and course chair!

Comment by hadessg: depends which school, idk abt others but in IIT yes.

Comment by pokkagreentea100: for the first time skipping, you won't receive any letter.

Comment by Wild-Lengthiness7600: depends on which mode u put for ur enrolment that time, if ur parents got put email they will email there if not send to ur hse mailbox

Comment by yq27: nopee, u won't get it on first time

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: when did u get the warning letter? was it the day after the class u skipped

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: i see ! thank youuu

Comment by pokkagreentea100: no leh, I skipped once recently and there was no warning letter

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: so i will get the warning letter even if its the first time is it

Comment by No_Orange_4342: i got it on the day

Comment by hadessg: really ah walao eh i skip 1 time kena bruh

Comment by Wild-Lengthiness7600: Last time i skip one class first time got email ah but it was a few days later but that was 2 years ago but highly doubt things changed

Comment by mount2010: It's based on % so skipping classes that barely had lessons in the week in the first place will do that e.g. TPFun classes

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: i see. thankss for the reply

Comment by Educational-Photo-77: Im from asc and i skipped gs ðŸ˜­

Comment by hadessg: ohh that makes so much sense cause i missed cict ahahahah
