Comment by SuitFinancial2209: why mc illegal?

Comment by hopefvll: cant get mc for day before iirc, since can be used as “false alibi” or smt similar. idk why they said ytd since they said at the start its tdy

Comment by SuitFinancial2209: orh

yea, standard is that clinics and such cant give mc for previous days, only the current day and onwards

if you missed lab test yesterday, that one legit gg, but if the same day you manage to get mc coverage for, then by right should be fine what
