Body: Sec 4 student taking o Ivl here, l'm js curious whether I can take upp math if I go into accountancy and finance (sch of business)? Or is upp math only offered mainly to engineering students? I really enjoy doing a math in sec sch and wish to broaden my knowledges on mathematics.

Comment by Previous-Basket3475: Upp math is prioritised for y3 students. You can enter if there are fewer students. But upp stands for a university preparation programme. It's university math (trust me, it's hard). It's not only for engineering students. U can apply from all courses.

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: i heard its similar to A math & its suggested for those who didnt take it in secondary school to learn.  (im not 100% sure)

Comment by hensum: I was from TP accountancy and finance and I took UPP math too. It is prioritised for graduating students but if there are available slots, and if you meet the entry requirements + good GPA, you are eligible to take the programme
