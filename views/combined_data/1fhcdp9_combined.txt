Comment by NyandaKun: On a side note, just wanna give some motivational message to everyone that your efforts have paid off in the April semester. Regardless of what grades your module is, passing the module matters and give yourself a care like playing games or cycle at the coast park. 

I wish you all the best for the results and remember to keep yourself healthy ðŸ«¶.
