Body: Hi everyone, as Open House 2025 is upcoming, some of you might be wondering what course you want to do once you graduate, whether is it from Secondary School or ITE. 

I am a student at Year 2, studying Food Nutrition and Culinary Science and I am willing to answer any questions about the course. 

**CONTEXT:**

In the course of study, at Year 1 , you would have to study the fundamentals for two semesters in order to prepare for the specialized study at year 2. 

In year 2, you would study the 3 areas: Food Science, Nutrition and Culinary Science. In Food Science, you would understand the chemical reactions taking place in the food and the various functions of ingredient such as adding additives to our food. In Nutrition, you would learn about understanding the health of different age groups and how would you go about planning their dietary plan and creating nutritional interventions. In culinary science, you would learn the techniques that you would need in the kitchen while also understand the science behind cooking e.g. what happens during baking. 

In year 3, you would have to go through a elective of choice. So far there are currently 6 electives in the website. However, 3 electives, Food Technology, Clinical Nutrition and Future Food Technology is the one offered by FNCS. The other 3 electives, Technical Sales & Marketing, SUTD pathway and Structured Work Based are offered by the School of Applied Science (Our department). You are free to choose which electives you want to study at the end of year 2 based on your passion and your interest. But also there is a major project which would take up one semester and hearing from my seniors, major project is the project that you have to put in alot of effort. 

Other than what I have said about what you gonna study in FNCS, you also need to go through lifeskills called TPFUN which teach you various stuff that are career-related, leadership-related and open mindset. We also have a module called Guided Learning where you would self education on things that you want to learn, which benefits you in terms of building your portfolio.

If you are more curious about my life in the study of the course or you want to find out more about the course, do comment down below and I would try my best to respond to them! 

Alternatively, you may visit the open house at Temasek Polytechnic from 9 to 11 January 2025 and ask my friends there. We also have a video of our diploma via Youtube
