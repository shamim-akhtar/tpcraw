Body: I want to do a sports cca but I don't have much sports history. Is it high commitment? Do you need to have experience to get in? (Also why is there no handball for girls ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)

Comment by nothappygooutside: all TP sports CCAs require experience to get in. its very competitive to get in because a lot of people want the CCA but not everyone can pass the trials. and yes, it's pretty high commitment because training usually starts at 6pm and can end as late as 11pm. you may also be called to come for training during term and semester breaks

Comment by nothappygooutside: TP sports club is a good alternative for those who do not have experience in a specific sport :)

Comment by sunghosguitar: you should js try! my friend tried without experience and got in! but defo u need to do ur best and try to stand out so that they shortlist u!! it is high commitment, all sport ccas are since we all train for compeitions!! but u should defo try all of them are q chill !!
