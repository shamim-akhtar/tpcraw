Body: I'm a second year student. After CCA, I saw a really cute girl In engineering block. She was waiting for her sister , a year 3. I thought she was my age because she looked like it. After talking a bit, it turns out that we had a lot in common and I asked for her number. We eventually hit it off and did "it" a month later in school after my CCA. The problem is that we had no protection and I just found out that she's actually 15 year old. But who could have known right? Such an amazing body and face. Will I get kicked out if her sister finds out and reports me?

Comment by neko_maritozzo: If I'm not wrong there is a chance of suspension from school? Not too sure, just make suer u don't do that in the future and also to make sure she isn't pregnant. If she is, please take responsibility.
