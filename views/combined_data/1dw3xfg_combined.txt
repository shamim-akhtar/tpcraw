Body: y2 psych student here, need help to find accountability/study partner. for context been lagging behind in classes but now I am trying best to catch up and would like someone with their shit together to guide me through. however, i'm not very extroverted and majority of my classmates are girls, who are kind of scary. as such am not close enough to people in my class to ask them to help me out. i tried the senior support thing last term but the other party has a very diff schedule from mine & it was hard to organize meetups for guidance

does tp offer anything for peer to peer guidance? or is there anything i can do to ask my classmates for help without coming off as fake or creepy/weird????
any constructive feedback appreciated, acknowledging any issues i have so i can change üôè
