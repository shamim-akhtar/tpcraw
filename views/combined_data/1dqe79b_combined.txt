Comment by ChillFluffwolf: It might affect your SEAL points, though.

Comment by Downtown-Monk9397: it will only affects your seal points

Comment by moistpeepoo: my whole class just skips tbh

Comment by coochie_destroya: tbf since everyone has seal points now, getting it doesnâ€™t even give you much advantage anymore

Comment by Extension_Fly_1243: But also since everyone has SEAL points not having it is also a big disadvantage
