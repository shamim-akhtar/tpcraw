Comment by MathematicianLoud947: It would be nice if all the male students bothered to flush the toilets after use. And not leave huge screeds of toilet paper all over the place. And try to aim better. Oh, and not hawk into the sinks then don't bother to rinse them clean. I wonder why the female toilets don't have this problem. I pity the poor cleaners.

Comment by Wild-Lengthiness7600: I thought the male toilets in tp were bad until i enlisted

Comment by ConsiderationTasty21: male toliets everywhere r disgusting what did u expect

Comment by None: Some females tend to pee all over the seat because they donâ€™t want their butt to touch the seat because of germs. Usually near the end of working hours or the mall closed.

Comment by MathematicianLoud947: This is specifically about polytechnic students. I believe girls there are much cleaner than the guys, since the female toilets tend to be less filthy.

Comment by None: Ye female students thankfully are more hygienic.

Comment by pokkagreentea100: as a female the toilets here aren't any better ðŸ˜­ girls pls practice proper toilet etiquette
