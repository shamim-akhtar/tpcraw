Body: hello! i recently got offered a spot in tp’s business pfp, and i’d love to hear from seniors about their experiences. how was the first few weeks like?

do we just get our schedules and start lectures immediately, or are there any orientation or other events beforehand? would really appreciate any insights or tips! thanks :)

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: you will receive your enrollment package soon, your orientation will be early april i think? and then late april you will start lessons, 20th april if im not wrong. PFP honestly is quite chill if you’re consistent and maintain your passing grades!
