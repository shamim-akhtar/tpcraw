Comment by Temporary_Sell_7377: I found it huzzah and threw it in long Kang 😶‍🌫️jokes, did you try going to the General office? Lost and found areas?

Comment by No_Kaleidoscope_8892: Hahahha I wish that was the case then at least I could go make a new card instead of being on the fence🥲😞😭
I did file a lost report in the lost and found office but so far they haven't contacted me so I'm assuming hey didn't find it🫠😭

Comment by Temporary_Sell_7377: Hope things go smoothly for you. Hopefully it comes back to you.
