Comment by tenkha_: Aerospace electronics from SP. Didn't have to go through interview for poly but if you want to know what the dip is about, basically is 70% EEE i.e. a lot of electrical basics, the rest would be introduction modules into aerospace which leaning more on to electronics in an airplane. Can quickly research the modules of the course to have a sense of what you'll be learning. Then Google search those modules. By the time you graduate, approx 40% of it is obsolete so like you can wow them with that, in the sense that you are resourceful by doing your own research and stuff.
