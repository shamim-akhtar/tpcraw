Comment by iamnothingbuta: Op you are cooked

Comment by davegrohlsbae: OKAY UPDATE UM i asked my cp and he say cannot so...😭😭😭😭 just so yall can clear up whatever😭😭😭

Comment by Mystical_Unicorn_09: if ur overall is below 50 then i think u js dont go exam and then remod but if above 50 alr gl ah...

Comment by nothappygooutside: non-graded pass does not mean you passed the subject. if that were the case, everyone can graduate from poly.

everyone must MINIMALLY have a cGPA of 1.0 to graduate. non-graded pass means your GPA is 1.0 no matter how badly or how well you do.

if non-graded pass means pass, then i might as well be absent for all my classes and automatically get 1.0 without trying. so i can get a diploma without attending school at all? that doesn't make sense.

this is briefed during every orientation AND at the start of every semester. you MUST re-take to meet attendance requirements.

Comment by nothappygooutside: no, if you get a non-graded pass, it is compulsory to re-take the subject. as long as you do not meet your attendance requirements, you cannot be said to have passed the subject. if you do not meet your attendance requirements on the 2nd try, you will be removed from your course.

Comment by davegrohlsbae: NOO i actually like this subj and can get a one😭😭😭😭

Comment by Ok-You-1212: Nooo so wasted siaaa 😭

Comment by davegrohlsbae: NO BC i wanted to purposely fail but my teacher say even if i leave the paper blank ill still pass so there's nothing i can do alr😭😭

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: You’re actually damn wrong… 

Non-graded pass means a pass that has no grade… that’s why it’s literally call that. 

Yes, no one is stopping you from submitting all your work and get the absolute minimum without showing up to class.

Comment by BudgetDevv: It depends - For a subject that is non-graded to begin with, you do fail said subject should you fall under its attendance requirement ( NGP doesn't make sense as a penalty for a subject that is already non-graded ). But for a graded subject, falling under the attendance requirements would mean that the highest achievable grade becomes D. That is not to dismiss the possibility of entirely failing the subject, however. 

So yes, I believe that remodding is not an option if you happen to pass the subject, even if it is a NGP

Comment by Mystical_Unicorn_09: oh fk then ur gpa die sia

Comment by BudgetDevv: Suffering from success haha

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: 100% right. The person you talking to is either a troll or can’t comprehend. 

People won’t fail non-graded sub, it’s designed to be impossible to fail.

Now, for regular subjects if you fail to meet 85%, all your assignments is still marked as per normal. Just that you won’t get above the passing grade.

You can score A but it’ll be a just pass.

But if you do fail, you fail of course.

I’m just curious if you alr fail to meet 85% but it’s a subject you can get A. Can you purposely fail on first try, and then try again next sem to get A or it’s still recognised as non-graded?

Comment by nothappygooutside: it is a requirement to have 85% attendance to pass every subject, graded or non-graded. this is constantly re-iterated at the start of the semester.

you must still re-take the subject but your GPA for that subject will remain at 1.0.

once again, the system you described does not make sense. people can basically graduate from poly without attending school at all.

Comment by nothappygooutside: PLEASE read the student handbook bro 🙏🙏

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: Coming from someone with actual first-hand knowledge of this. I have failed a module before.

Your subject grade will still be non-graded pass.

Comment by BudgetDevv: Guy's dissing himself with an alt, take no notice of him.

Your question is an interesting one, I thought about it too, but no idea. From what I was told by higher ups, remodding due to failure isn't capped. But this scenario is sorta different

Comment by BudgetDevv: "Attendance

There is an 85% attendance requirement. If you arrive late in class, your attendance 

will be computed as ABSENT even though it will be reflected as LATE in the attendance 

system. A student who attains below 85% attendance in a subject will be graded as ‘P’ 

(if he/she passes the subject) and ‘F’ (if he/she fails the subject). The P grade has a 

Grade point average of 1. A student who obtains a ‘P’ grade will not be eligible for the

Diploma with Merit and the Director’s Lists award (refer to Section on “Criteria for 

Freshmen and Junior Director’s Lists)."

Comment by BudgetDevv: I recommend you take your own advice, it appears that the prevalence of LLMs have instilled a personality of "confidently wrong" in individuals such as yourself...what a sad sight to behold

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: Oh that’s sad. Guess the moment you hit 82% that’s it already. Can just give up and just pass already.

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: Which one is his alt haha. Idk how can someone sound so wrong and confident.

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: Absolutely amazing

Comment by BudgetDevv: You also seem to make the assumption that people who fall under the attendance requirements do not submit their work - It is very possible to fall under the requirements just from being late

Comment by nothappygooutside: whatever you quoted is completely true but it is literally a requirement to have at least 85% attendance for every subject to graduate from poly. it does not matter whether you failed or passed. 

your quotation does not address graduation requirements, it only addresses how modules are graded based on attendance.

Comment by nothappygooutside: once again, i was told since y1 (and it is quite common sense) that attendance is compulsory in poly.

i can pass a subject easily by doing all my self-learning at home without going to school at all. it's doable for many people. then i can just get a 1.0 for every subject and that is sufficient for me to graduate from poly. obviously the school knows about this loophole so that's the reason why there are attendance requirements in the first place.

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: I think it's a sadder sight to see two fragile people here with inflated egos making a mountain out of a molehill. Do what suits you best, though. I'm just stating the observations of most people reading the comments.

Comment by nothappygooutside: i mean, you are entitled to your own view and so am i. relying on insults to prove a point does show a lot.

i believe neither of us struggle with attendance so i hope we don't ever face the prospect of getting a non-graded pass. whether you choose to believe that there is an attendance requirement to graduate from poly or not is your choice. but your ignorance of such a requirement will result in you having to re-take subjects if you do not meet attendance requirements (which i pray does not happen).

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: That's what I did. I didn't bother to come for that class anymore and became more mindful of my attendance next time.

Comment by BudgetDevv: Fit perception, it seems to be a new account and their only comments happen to be on this post

Comment by BudgetDevv: "I'm wrong but Imma roll with it anyway"

Comment by BudgetDevv: >

I don't think you're reading my replies at all, for a non-graded subject this approach will not work out...and it is mandatory to pass all of them 

That being said, downvoting my comments over a bruised ego reflect poorly on yourself. If the student handbook didn't support my view, I would have edited my comment to reflect the truth

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: Getting triggered over someone online is embarrassing on your part. Just put the fries in the bag.

Comment by BudgetDevv: Not really, I'm just telling you to follow your own advice. I apologize if I did hurt your feelings

> i mean, you are entitled to your own view and so am i.

"They are entitled to their opinions but they suffer from the notable disadvantage of being completely wrong"

Either way, I think continuing this convo is pointless, and that the OP would figure out which comment better highlights the truth

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: Haha pretty funny cause once u hit uni, attendance becomes a mere suggestion.

Comment by davegrohlsbae: SAY SIKE RN😭😭 i actually like this subj and its prob one of the only subjs i can get a for😭😭😭 its just all of the classes for this subj are at 9am and i cannot wakeup on time😭😭😭😭😭

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: Haha created after this post. Quite interesting indeed!

Comment by nothappygooutside: hi besides our disagreement just now - i dont know who that person is, i wouldnt create an account to clown myself. i did not engage as the account is probably trolling. just to clarify.

Comment by nothappygooutside: assuming i'm downvoting you is hard work... i do not downvote people unless they're rude and so far this conversation has at least been productive and respectful.

do you think it makes sense to go to school only for non-graded subjects and ignore attendance for all my graded modules (which are clearly more important and specific to the industry you are specialising in)?

Comment by nothappygooutside: your assumption that i'm downvoting you shows how poorly you react to dissenting views.

i never once resorted to personal insults to prove a point. that may be the reason why you are being downvoted.

for all i know, other people are downvoting my comments too. they are entitled to disagree with me and i do not assume that you are the ONLY ONE disagreeing with me because you are currently the only person engaging with me. you should also know people are entitled to disagree with you and may choose not to respond to your comments.

i respect that you have a differing opinion, but there is no need to blindly accuse people. your assumption is complacent.

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: Hm. I thought attendance also affects grades in uni? I know people barely attend lectures though.

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: That is why it is important to keep track of your attendance. The best practice is just to be present and punctual for all classes so you don't have to worry about all this.

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: TLDR please 🙏 No one's reading allat

Comment by Fit-Perception9449: Bro's yapping 😂😂😂

Comment by MilkTeaRamen: It’s course dependable. But my course doesn’t have attendance requirement in the sense that you’ll get a non-graded or fail. 

Some modules do however allocate 5% overall for attendance. 

For those where attendance don’t even add to class part, you’ll notice half the class will be empty halfway thru the sem, and the last lesson is almost empty.
