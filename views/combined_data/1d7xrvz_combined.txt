Body: Hi, year 1 ASC student here, just wondering if it’s possible to drop a subject. Will it affect my overall GPA? Is it even possible? (I’m really struggling with MAS 😭)

Comment by strwberri111: 🫠was in ur position before, my advice is just try to get at least a pass or C/C+ at least for that mod and score high for the other subjs. speaking from experience, that mod rlly pull down my gpa for that sem and i had to work extremely hard for the other sems..

Comment by NyandaKun: Hi, I feel you . Being in the school of applied science can be abit daunting when it comes to like memory work or like you know having to study very hard for different modules like MAS . I got friends too who wants to drop (which I mean just want to lazy study and get a pass) a subject , which I respect their decision if they not wish to have the kind of knowledge like year 2 subjects that doesn’t interest them . 

But I want to emphasize to you that year 1 modules is recommended not to drop because it builds up on your fundamental . You would thank it for it when it comes to year 2 . I know that you are struggling with MAS even I myself want to fking abolish some of the chapters like the bloody A MATH stuffs like who da faq use that ? But still, I would strongly recommend you to build up on the base GPA like in a way is like an insurance . If you somehow dont do well in the future like in year 2 , your year 1 GPAs would be of a build up for you. 

I would rather expect you to like at least get a C at most, cause that’s like the minimum that everyone should get ; a grade D would give you a gpa of 1 which is not a very good start in you because that shows a lot of flaws in you that you would then need to improve on as the semester goes . 

In conclusion, don’t give up on building up your GPA, you need to start off with a moderate start rather than a BAD start to make yourself abit less burden. 

If you have any academic problems or certain modules that you need help with, I can try my best to give you some of an advice on modules ; believe me, I face the same way as a ASC student .
