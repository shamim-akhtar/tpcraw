Body: Hi all , has everyone received their school fees payment.  In the invoice it does not shows that my second payout for the bursary is being used to deduct the total amount. Has anyone noticed it and does anyone know when are they gonna give out the second payout of the bursary. Thanks

Comment by Accomplished_Desk177: Hi. I received the email on the school fees. But not the bursary payout yet.

Comment by SnooCookies9235: the 2nd pay out is most likely gna come out in mid dec - start jan? sometimes they'll deduct sch fees first then aftwards send us our bursary so dont worry!

Comment by Vinhunter666: Yea , thatâ€™s the problem the bursary comes in slower than the school fees invoice. Before this there was a time post about this too but then someone said that the bursary wil offset the school fees amount. But the invoice nvr show

Comment by Accomplished_Desk177: Mabe check with the general office ?? I got PSEA so it will auto detuct the fees.

Comment by Vinhunter666: PSEA and bursary different

Comment by Accomplished_Desk177: Ya I know
