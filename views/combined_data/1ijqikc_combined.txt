Body: Anyone did this part time diploma and managed to get into SUSS/SMU law? Is it possible to get into SUSS law LLB with this diploma?

Comment by nothappygooutside: very highly unlikely, unless you have taken A levels/have a previous diploma and have excellent grades. even students from full-time diploma law & management will struggle to get into law schools. only the top-performing ones enrol into law schools
