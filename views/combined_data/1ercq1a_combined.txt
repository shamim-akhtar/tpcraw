Body: hii does anyone know if i can get in the competitive team even without prior competition exp? i go to a vb acad so i know the basics and played in unofficial games before so i sort of know how a game goes. i just nvr participated in an official comp like nsg before cuz it wasnt my cca in sec sch. do i still stand a chance to get in cuz i know tp vb competitive afðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ i saw someone say the trials they will ask for our achievements for sch so is it competitive team only take in people who were alr in vb in sec sch? Pls lmk!!

Comment by IndependentNo6105: personal experience: when u sign up with the google form they provided they will already start filtering out ppl who have never had volleyball experience. the trials are just for show only they already have their ideal in mind so theres no point

Comment by LetterheadMost3677: ohh but is there a recreational team or is the whole cca is competitive team?

Comment by AtomZones: fr, this though :(

Comment by IndependentNo6105: every sports cca is competitive only there is no just for fun
