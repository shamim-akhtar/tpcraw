Body: I am enrolling into tp accountancy and finance , I just got an offer from an accounting firm internship I can until the end of April where school will start. But they are asking if I can come 2 days a week 9-5. Will it be possible .

Comment by nothappygooutside: as long as the timing doesn't clash, go ahead. the semester schedule usually only comes out in march or april, so ensure those two days you're required to come to work, you have no classes. 

fyi, in y1, you usually only have one day of the week with no classes, or you have none at all. i'm friends with some a&f students, and in y1 none of them had free days on their schedule. so to play it safe, you might want to shorten your internship period.

Comment by Obvious-Data1914: Thanks I think I'm just gonna stop it when school starts
