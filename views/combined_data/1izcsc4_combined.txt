Body: For context I finished o level last year and have been admitted to aerospace engineering for 2025 . During my holiday last year I looked at tp’s pld requirements and saw that MacBooks could be used for aerospace engineering although not the best choice. So I decided to buy a brand new MacBook Pro for school ,only to check the requirements this year to find it listed as not recommended. Will the lecturer force me to by a windows laptop or will they close a blind eye.

Comment by DivoKing69: I bought an m4 pro MacBook Pro with 24gb of ram 512 storage is it strong enough

Comment by Southern-Cry-8020: i think if u can run the required stuff on parallels then you shld be fine? idk
this was what i heard ah, cuz im in comp eng and im thinking of getting a macbook pro too

Comment by TurtleRiskyBoi: For yr1 sem1 u dont rlly need high specs cos the most u wld run is python. But from yr1 sem 2 onwards, u wld run stuff like 3d modelling and simulations so it needs a laptop that can meet the requirements. Other than to run those, u can use anything rlly.

Comment by Asleep_Market1202: They won’t *force* you to buy a Windows laptop, but they’ll probably strongly recommend it, especially if certain software isn’t Mac-compatible. Most lecturers just care that you can run the required programs—if you can find workarounds (Boot Camp, Parallels, cloud alternatives), they’ll likely close one eye. Worst case, you might have to use school lab PCs for some tasks. If you're worried, just email them and check.

Comment by DivoKing69: I mean I have a windows laptop that can run msfs I think that could suffice if I need a windows?
