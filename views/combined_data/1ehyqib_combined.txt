Body: hello does anybody know who to contact for seal points allocation? it’s for an external event that was promoted by TP as a volunteer opportunity, but there’s isn’t an in-charge (since it’s external), so perhaps there’s someone who is in charge of seal points?

Comment by AtomZones: okay so y1 here, if I’m not wrong u just show proof that you volunteered to ur care person then boom, seal points in a few days

Comment by theuselessmastermind: you'd need to check w the external organiser, some of them will send it to TP for you and you don't have to do anything, some of them will ask for your details so they can give you a certificate/doc of some sort for you to submit yourself, etc. just check with the organiser. if really nothing like that then submit it yourself in the TPOSS / ask your CP to do it

Comment by _potatostick: thank you
