Body: Hi! We are a group of students in Guided Learning and have embarked on a project with TP Library. We aim to increase awareness and encourage greater use of the library’s resources, services, and facilities among students. Nearing the end of the semester, we aim to launch a one-time workshop for TP students. 

 Please spare 2 minutes of your time to fill up the survey. Your response will be greatly appreciated!
