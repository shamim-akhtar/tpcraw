Comment by nothappygooutside: SEAL points do not really help in local uni applications especially if you are aiming for sought-after degrees like LLB or medicine. i know seniors that have 3.9+ gpas with almost no portfolio and they got accepted into local uni, while seniors with 3.5-3.6 gpas and amazing portfolios get rejected. i guess if you have significant achievements and positions under your portfolio it might do you some good but local unis will always look at academic performance.

you're only in y2 and there is still time to pull up your gpa, albeit with difficulty. gpas usually just keep decreasing from y1. it rarely gets pulled up. by the time you reach y3 it's almost impossible to pull up, even with internship, which is why people stress the importance of doing well in y1 so you have more "leeway" for your gpa to decrease in y2 and y1. nevertheless, do your absolute best in y2 and y3 to at least maintain your gpa.

if local uni is not an option, that's not the end of the world. this is coming from a senior who just finished intern.

Comment by Character_Algae_8280: It's true that it doesn't help directly, but maybe you could explore other options, I know some people with like a 3 gpa with a good portfolio but somehow got to ntu? I'm not sure, but I also know that ntu got holistic applications that account for seal points and ignore gpa.
