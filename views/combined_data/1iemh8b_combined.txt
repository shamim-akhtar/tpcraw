Body: Not that I care that much la but as an IIT student myself I find it a bit weird. Other schools don't use this subreddit meh?

Comment by Comfortable-Net-5126: notice how all these complaints only came up this year after they supposedly changed the syllabus for our batch, if u read all the posts u will realise theres something seriously wrong with the school. every point raised is agreeable
- not even getting our results for some projs and tests, not getting feedback for them, testing topics they said weren't tested in tests
- teaching the main main part enabling us to start out on our biggest project compiling two modules only two weeks before the submission and that too we had to learn it on our own during e learning week?
- the teachers unnecessary getting mad at questions from students and scolding them without a reason
- lack of communication between the lecturers.  the project specs are mostly unclear so when the teachers give out extra sets of instructions for the students, they are not discussed among the the lecturers and each class gets diff set of instructions 
- some classes getting consultations for projects and some not

i could say a lot more but if so many people are complaining from IIT school that too only this batch there has to be something wrong don't you think, instead of blaming on the fact that IIT students are just more online on reddit

Comment by BudgetDevv: Hm, I spoke to the admin before and they said it is anonymized

Comment by Dangerous_Trouble570: Admin is lying. Course chair told me he saw my previous term feedback and invited me for feedback session with him and diploma manager 🤷‍♂️

Comment by Aggravating-Tie832: hahaha can we actually believe them.........?

Comment by BudgetDevv: Oh damn that is kinda lame tbh. That being said however, I did leave some negative reviews previously, but wasn't invited

Comment by bricklegos: IIT seems to attract a lot of powertripping ppl who enjoy making other ppls lives worse
