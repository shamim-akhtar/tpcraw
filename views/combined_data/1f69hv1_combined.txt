Body: Hii, I'm in y1 this year. In y2, any seniors know roughly when is our practicum 2 and how long is the duration? cos my family is planning to go overseas next year, and I don't want to clash with my practicum.

Comment by ralsiehoo: Hi, Practicum 2 should last around 5 weeks around end October to early December (maybe 6-7 if you have a lot of make up dates ðŸ˜Š)
