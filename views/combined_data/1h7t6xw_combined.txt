Body: Hello! We are students from Republic Polytechnic who are doing our final year project. We are collecting survey responses from polytechnic students. Our study is centered on adolescents' perception towards mental health.

Please note that there will be three surveys in total to be completed. As of now, Survey 1 is open and you can find it in the link [here](https://republicpolytechnic.questionpro.com/t/AY0UtZ4y7S). 

After the completion of Survey 1, we will inform you via email if you will proceed to Survey 2 and Survey 3. 

Survey 1 will run from today until the 9th of December 2024.  

Additionally, we will run a lucky draw and if you successfully complete all three surveys, you will have a chance to win $150 via PayNow.
