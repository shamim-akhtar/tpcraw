Comment by Successful_Bear276: Congratulations! I didn't get mine from Aerospace Electronics (TP) but for Aerospace Engineering (TP). I heard they only give out only for your first two choices. I have no idea, but from having a hearing from the ground, it seems like they may ask about why this passion, what are your aspirations in the future with this Diploma etc.

All the best for the interviews! ðŸ˜†

Comment by dtunerz: Simply why do you want to join

Comment by littlegreyw0lf: ask you why you chose the diploma. To make sure your choice is clear and not because of pressure from parents "just because it offers a good career", "your uncle is in this line and doing well", etc. Make sure it is your own choice and interest.

Comment by None: They will ask about aerospace electronics.

Comment by Mountain_Remote4347: Thank you!!
