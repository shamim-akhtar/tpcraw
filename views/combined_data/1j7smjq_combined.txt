Body: hi, I hope there’s seniors or anyone who can help. I am an upcoming year 3 student from the diploma in accountancy and finance. I am starting to look for my internship, and I was wondering what websites should I use to search for it. 

I appreciate all the help, and thank you in advance! hope everyone is enjoying their semester break!

Comment by nothappygooutside: hi for ur internship they will actually send a list of companies for u to choose from. u can't choose companies from outside that list. they'll send the list in may i think, then you're given one month plus to apply to and interview with those companies

Comment by Sea-Policy1707: oh but our course head advise us to self secure internship positions. they encourage us to find companies but at the end of the day, still need the school’s approval.

Comment by nothappygooutside: wah... maybe things changed because my information is from the a&f seniors my age HAHAHAH
