Body:     Just  recently got back my O lvl results and i managed to get net 6 for ELR2B2-C and plan to go to TP CE !!!  yay :D ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
    Anyway,  was wondering if its possible to get any scholarships in y1 based on O-lvl score + achievements? Ive heard from some of my classmates that you can, is it true? If so, how to apply and if not, are there any scholarships i can apply for ? (Im a long term pass holder)  
   Any help would be deeply appreciated and thanks for reading!
