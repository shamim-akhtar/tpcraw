Body: I made an axs transaction via the website but after the payment, the outstanding balance is still there on the website, is there a different place to check if my fees are paid or not? Like oss or somethinf

Comment by NotHighAchiever: if you alr made payment and monies deducted, should be fine

the system will probably take a while to update

unless youâ€™ve paid a few weeks ago then better call up the school

Comment by _potatostick: yea u can check in tp oei (sharepoint) under financial matters > student finance enquiry
