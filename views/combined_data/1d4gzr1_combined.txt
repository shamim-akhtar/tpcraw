Comment by iamnothingbuta: You need them to maintain your gpa

Comment by aminlee9: some are pass/fail in a sense it's a waste of time as you simply need to submit something (of minimal quality) to pass the subject that does not affect your gpa at all, but is needed for you to move to the next sem. some are graded that will actually contribute to your gpa. chck ur school's handbook for more details

Comment by Street_Musician_580: There's this tpfund called ecomms and procomm i believe those are graded. I haven't had procomm yet but ik ecomm is graded

Comment by NyandaKun: Nope.

Comment by Low-Rabbit2264: Procomm is graded
