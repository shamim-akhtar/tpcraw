Comment by Middle-Complaint9127: Erm yeah.. but depends on how the cohort does. If the paper was damn rabak theyâ€™ll be as lenient as possible to save more people from failing lol. This applies for normal term tests as well

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: Depends on the academic head for that module. If its mathematics related, perhaps.
