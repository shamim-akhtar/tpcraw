Comment by xRhyxe: you basically need a laptop for almost everything, using a ipad is possible too depending on your course but itâ€™ll make your life much harder.

Comment by akinowo: depends on what your course is, some classes maybe dn laptop as much but essentially all your materials are made online so yes

Comment by Aiyoowafap: Yes. All the communication and materials are posted online. You can find the specs of the laptop needed for the course you go into on the school website
