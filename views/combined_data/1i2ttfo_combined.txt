Comment by mount2010: Canopy Coffee Club (HSS level 2 just inside from East Gate) has it, and for very cheap too

Might be confusing it for mee soto but I'm pretty sure they have mee rebus too, correct me if I'm wrong

edit: yes, just check their menu on Google Maps

Comment by SuperbMaterial5483: ooo nice thank u
