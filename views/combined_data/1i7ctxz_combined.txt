Body: I am enrolling in April as a PFP student in T50 Aerospace electronics and I was wondering if the school would allow LOA and give me makeup classes for the lessons that i have missed out on during the LOA?

Comment by strwberri111: doubt so, usually if ur absent regardless of what reasons, there won’t be a makeup lesson. Makeup lessons are usually done if u missed out smtg important especially if it’s needed for you to understand a certain concept for hands on test/debrief. Also, are you going overseas for study purpose/family matters or leisure? bc smts they may be quite strict if u take loa for no reason/deem as invalid & ur loa may get rejected.

Comment by MathematicianLoud947: Nope, definitely not. You can ask your tutor to go over the materials with you, but that will depend on their schedule unless they have time to sit with you in class for an hour or so. Most lecturers will be happy you're making the effort, though, and will try to make time.

Comment by flabbergastedfennel: If you're lucky, u got lecturers that record their lessons on msteams so you have some form of explanation but otherwise no makeup lesson

Comment by PersonalAd3618: I'm going overseas for like football competition

Comment by mount2010: Dunno about PFP or ENG school, but a lot of our materials are on POLITEMall (poly LMS). If you missed class you can refer to materials for what you missed. Usually the lectures are MS teams recorded in IIT, but that might not be the case in ENG.

Comment by Most_Spring_9825: This can, just show proof of the competition and plane ticket. For me my comp was like only 3 days, I stayed more than 3 days due to my flight. I did that in 2023 I went Korea for a cup stacking competition. Apply LOA under representatives of national competition,
