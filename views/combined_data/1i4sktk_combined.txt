Comment by mount2010: In the weekly slides section of politemall, go to the latest section, there is a part called nect quiz. This shows the tested items. Then use Cisco Netacad to watch videos and revise on the topics listed. Also review the slides from week 1 onwards.

Comment by mount2010: Should be in the slides, near the beginning

Its where you download packet tracer, the "Networking Basics" course

Reason why I don't link directly is that the slides also have instructions on how to login

Comment by IndependentNo6105: abuden not everybody looks at that right
