Body: hi fellow reddit users :) 

for context im a 16 year old in sg sec sch in east zone and im planning on taking the business route. so common business in tp, then bridging over to accountancy and finance in tp. however i'm not so sure about the job spectrum. i've been interested in being a forensic accountant but tbh salary matters and frm what i've seen forensic accountants salary is like 4000-5000 ?? 

so basically this is js to ask if yall have any recs for university orrrrr about forensic accountancy or really any high paying and fun business/finance/accounting jobs. 

i actl never thought that i wld take up business but its been super interesting for me. 😁😁😁 

wish i wldve taken poa but my sch doesn't offer poa okay now im js rambling to achieve the 200 word count HAHA 

my subject combi: 
- eng 
- math 
- sci (chem/bio) 
- pure lit 
- combi humans (ss/geog) 

OH AND ALSO i do have a backup plan in case business is smth that im still fumbling over to go to tmjc so if yall have tips for tmjc and stuff lmkk and maybe what subj combi u shld take for business in future. i dont take a math so um ya 

ok that shld be 200 characters thank you for reading 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

Comment by alexnoob13: Ur taking O-lvls this year? U should def go poly than jc than maybe university so u can earn more money as an accountant. My mum works as an accountant and she earns abt 6k-7k per month and she only graduated from poly. I'm only 14 so I don't know much but that's what I heard from family and friends.
