Comment by xRhyxe: Hi there, your eae offer will be revoked and you will need to go through JAE / DAE for your poly applications

Comment by AtomZones: If fail means eae revoked, youâ€™ll have to go for jae/dae

Comment by Duck79639: depends if the course is in high demand, if not they may accept a d7

Comment by alts013: DAE
