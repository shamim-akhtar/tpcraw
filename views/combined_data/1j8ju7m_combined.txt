Body: Is there a CCA for Art? I only saw visual Art and Writing Club, is it the same thing? When I say Art I mean like painting and drawing type. Is CSC good too? Is there any recommendations?

Comment by TheoryPatient6067: CSC is not art related

Comment by Strict_Composer_9685: yess vawc does painting and drawing as well if that's what you're looking for

Comment by mount2010: The Japanese Cultural Appreciation Group (JCG) also does Monday drawing sessions if you're more anime-oriented!
