Comment by Asleep_Market1202: I've been in the cybersecurity field for about eight years now, and here's my real talk. Singapore offers solid stability, especially in roles within government and finance, and if you land the right gig, the work-life balance can be pretty decent. The local scene is great for building networks and making regional connections. But on the flip side, if you look at opportunities overseas, places like the US and Europe are offering significantly higher pay and a faster pace of innovation. After a few years here, you might start feeling like the market has become a bit stagnant if you're eager for rapid career growth. My advice would be to use Singapore as a launching padâ€”build your skills, gain solid experience, and then keep an open mind about moving abroad when the right opportunity comes along.
