Comment by coochie_destroya: Is there alot chiobu in this course? I wanted EAE but failed üò¢

Comment by Wide-Stretch3799: what is the internship like

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: Ok but tbf she wrote a stellar recommendation for me. + the toxicity and demanding personality is also built on a foundation of granite. My boss is competent af. Think of it like a louis litt from suits except more toxic but slightly less retarded.

Comment by Some-Telephone-4973: whats the progression to uni like for students in the course? yourself included

Comment by Affyyy: no

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: No. Not from my experience. If you failed the interview for EAE then‚Ä¶idk man. Seems pretty impossible for everyone who got shortlisted.

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: Interned at one of the big 4. I can just feel the toxicity emanating from the partners from 7am onwards everyday. Turnover for my dept was extremely high. Almost 90% of the people i worked with excluding interns left the year after they got their bonus. 

Although you are an intern and the expectation of you is pretty low, the moment you take a look at your colleagues and managers around you, I think you would re evaluate your choices of pursuing a career in this field.

Almost most of the partners have health issues advancing that far in to their career.

I once saw my boss using cold water instead of boiling water for her cup noodles just to ‚Äúsave time‚Äù like wtf? Some antics are really hard to forget considering she is worth like 20-30m


(Im avoiding specifics lol) 

‚ÄúIf it is your problem, you better make it everyone‚Äôs problem to solve the problem faster‚Äù - partner (those who are in the dept will know of this commonly used phrase)

‚ÄúSupervision is a burden‚Äù - my supervisor

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: I‚Äôll just say this. Study hard and you‚Äôll be able to make it.

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: Lol keep quiet in ntu biz.

Comment by Intelligent-Laugh972: Honestly, any laptop will do just fine.
