Comment by ohmyfats: It's not impossible to raise your gpa for the remaining sems! I was in the same boat as you, gpa 2.6 in y1s1. that gave me a wake up call so i worked my ass off and managed to graduate with a gpa of 3.7. Never lose hope and keep working hard! All the best!!

Comment by Accurate-Passenger89: You still have time to improve! no need to worry too much,¬†And if ur worried abt written exams, as ur sem progress projects and other components will increase and written exams will be minimal (But again depends on what course ur in).¬†Getting easier or harder from now, depends on how much hardwork you put. Just try to give ur best, you‚Äôll be fine. Feel free to pm if u have any qns!¬†

2.89 for Y1S1

3.15 final Sem.

Note that this is during COVID + my ass was lazy

So yes, definitely possible.

Comment by Latter_Special655: not really my 1.1 gpa was 2.66 currently at 2.1 wif cgpa wif 3.04, not the best but at least above 3.0, im in an IT course and erm lets just say im not the best at what i do i just learn so that i can earn the bucks but i cant see a future wif my current gpa so i might be wasting my time right now but its ok lah as the saying goes Ëµ∞‰∏ÄÊ≠•Áúã‰∏ÄÊ≠•ü§ìüëçüèª

Comment by Rimuruuuuuuuuu: Not rly that cooked but its time to lock in, sending hopium + some of my brain juice to you gl, dont stress

Comment by No_Astronomer2047: actually i think it depends on the course. no worries, there is still time for you to improve. though the first semester is important BUT you can still do your very best for the second semester. no matter what it is, you have tried your best! try and try again! hope everything goes well, don‚Äôt be too discouraged!!

Comment by jasminebubblegum: you still have plenty of time to improve, just make sure your gpa doesnt flunk under 2, keep it up, your gpa isnt bad in my pov. but year 2, you can pull your gpa up as well, thats what i did after flunking 1.2. year 3 you can try acing your internship etc. theres still plenty of time just dont slack too much!! anyw good job on your gpa still!

Based on others/most of the people around me, Y1 was the easiest and the hardest was one of the study semesters in Y2/3.

Personally, and genuinely, I found year 1 to be the HARDEST like for real. And the easiest was Y2S2/Y3S1 for me. These 2 semesters also happened to be the most credit unit heavy semesters. Do note that in year 1 there were many modules too but the CUs were lower somehow due to 2 CU pass fails.

Y1S1 to Y2S1 had many computer related modules such as programming and CAD which I really struggled with. I will admit that I fooled around too much as well and I didn't know how grades in poly worked like fr. I only realized that I was done for when the term "Indicative Grade Profile" was introduced in Y1S2 during a form class lesson. I thought from there on to just keep my GPA above 2 and go to some private university. However COVID came and all of a sudden there was SO MUCH MORE TIME to study and sleep. Also, the after Y2S1 there were no computer related modules and I started finding things more manageable but still tough. I got 3.5 for Y2S2 and my GPA was 2.7 or something, I then calculated that I just need to repeat this for the last year and my CGPA would be above 3 and I would be able to try for SIT. Somehow I managed to do better than expected and get 3.69 and then 3.5 for the internship.

After all of that, I even calculated what my GPA would have been if I didn't fool around in my first half of poly, I got a figure of somewhere between 3.3-3.4 CGPA, and I realized I still wouldn't have made it into NTU either way üòÖ so there's that. Assumption was B+/A for everything except computer related modules where I would get D+ to C+ max.

TLDR;
Y1S1 is not necessarily the hardest, Y1 was the hardest for me and it could be the same for a select few too.

Comment by okwhatelse: 1.03 gpa, is it over?

Comment by Lonely_mugger15: Woah thats impressive, did you literally get 4.0 for all 5 sems

Comment by elijahvawgora: wait ohmyfats may i know how u manage to get 4.0 for so many sem??

Im not very smart so like how did you manage to do it 

Also ur internship also got 4.0? How was it? 

Is ur internship graded?

Comment by elijahvawgora: btw may i ask how do you do well / ace your internship? rn I changing course so idk what yet but maybe can use a random course internship or maybe urs plss

Comment by Altruistic-Use642: it‚Äôs best to talk to your care person as such results in my POV it is best  repeat y1 as most  of your module u might have to remod so no dif and even if u work extremely hard in the end of your 3 years it‚Äôs only a 3.1-3.3 max so u can kiss the NUS and NTU dream away PS : i got a 1.43 in ENG i retook my y1 in TP now i am studying at NUS engineering in medicine it really depends on your choice and poly don‚Äôt really gives two shits about your age so take your time

Comment by ohmyfats: thanks!! I got 4.0 for 4/5 sems! I had a great support system in TP and that really helped a lot

Comment by okwhatelse: not really aiming for NTU and NUS, you think it‚Äôs possible to go SIT?

Comment by Secure-Emu3730: Wow!!! 4.0 means Full marks! I didn't think that was possible! Congratulations!

Comment by Altruistic-Use642: can but try to get a 3.3 3.1 will only get u civil engineering 3.3
the chances of having to choose the course that you like would be much higher
