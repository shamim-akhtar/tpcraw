Body: hi, iâ€™m joining tp pfp this year & just wondering if anyone knows when the pfp orientation dates are? i heard itâ€™s different from the y1s (their ori is 8th & 15-17th). also, must pfp students buy lab coats/goggles etc? 
my parents wanna go overseas arnd that time so i better check that it doesnâ€™t interfere w ori ðŸ˜… thank you!
