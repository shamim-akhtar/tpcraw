Comment by Stabant_: They mainly focus on any 'extracurriculars' that are relevant to your field. I would recommend getting a list of them ready so you don't get lost or forget anything important mid interview.

Comment by W4773N: They can ask you questions like why you chose TP, ur course, ur CCA etc.

Comment by NeitherBrick2556: have they started sending out interview invitations?

Comment by None: Wait wdym arent we year 1 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ what extracurriculars could we have that is related to our course.

Comment by None: Did they ask anything else? And also what happens if the extracurriculars arent related to my course

Comment by None: My cca isnt related to my course at all though

Comment by None: Other than that nothing else right?

Comment by None: Yup did you get it?

Comment by W4773N: Ur courseâ€™s interest grp if youâ€™re in it

Comment by W4773N: it shld be fine I think cuz they can get to know more about you outside ur course

Comment by W4773N: Other than that, they can still ask you questions that you wonâ€™t expect, letâ€™s just say what advice would you give to your juniors. Itâ€™s more of like for them to see how you would respond to the questions they ask rather than the answer, so a tip wld be to be yourself.

Comment by NeitherBrick2556: no :( but i applied for a diff scholarship

Comment by gigiiii95: did you just receive only recently? i also applied but havenâ€™t receive anyth ðŸ¥²

Comment by None: will they ask any questions that are quite hard to answer like how do you think you can use the knowledge gained in your course to contribute to society or something ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Comment by None: Yupp what academic school are u in though?

Comment by W4773N: There is a chance they might ask that kind of question

Comment by gigiiii95: business

Comment by Agreeable_Rub_9269: I'm from business and I just received mine!
