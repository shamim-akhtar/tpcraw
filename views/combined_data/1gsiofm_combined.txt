Body: I was just wondering if I could take other courses in uni with a bme diploma and Iâ€™m just wondering if there are things I need to take note of before going into this course?

Comment by Terrible_Condition24: search up university course requisites. If I'm not wrong you can take other engineering related courses and probably business.

Comment by reallyconfuse: Okay thank you so much
