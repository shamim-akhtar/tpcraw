Comment by blackrosethorn3: Hi senior grad here, ask Mr Simon. CGMP is all abt understanding the principles. Memorising gets u so far.Â 

Comment by Own-Can6471: Hes my tutor but honestly I still don't understand what he's saying ðŸ’€

Comment by blackrosethorn3: You can ask for consult. He usually helps those who sincerely come to him for help.
