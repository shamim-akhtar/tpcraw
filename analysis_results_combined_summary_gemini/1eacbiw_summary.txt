The Reddit post and comments center on the experience of online group interviews for the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main discussion revolves around the interview formatâ€”specifically, whether it's a turn-based system, the types of questions asked (including self-introduction, reasons for applying, relevant experience, and comparative strengths), the number of interviewees in each group (estimated at 3-5), and strategies for answering effectively (responding concisely and avoiding rushing).

The overall sentiment is a mixture of anxious anticipation and helpfulness.  While some commenters express concern about the potentially confrontational nature of certain questions (like "why should they pick you over others"), the predominant tone is supportive and collaborative.  Commenters share their experiences and offer advice to the original poster, creating a helpful environment for prospective students.  No specific complaints about school facilities or other aspects of Temasek Polytechnic are mentioned. The focus remains entirely on the interview process itself.

No specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management arise from this Reddit thread. The discussion is solely focused on student experiences with the EAE interview process and strategies for success.  However, monitoring student feedback on the interview process and gathering more data on student experiences could be beneficial for refining the interview format to minimize anxiety and improve the candidate experience.
