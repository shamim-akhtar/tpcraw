The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of Year 1 students in the Applied Science (ASC) course at Temasek Polytechnic, specifically focusing on the perceived excessive workload during the second semester of Year 1.  Students express concerns about the volume of group projects and assignments, particularly in modules like NUH and CBB (where slide quality is criticized), and the heavy content of Term Test 2.  They seek advice on coping strategies and inquire about the workload in subsequent years.

The overall sentiment is one of stress and anxiety regarding the academic demands of the course.  Students express feelings of being overwhelmed and struggling to keep up.  The comments offer support and practical advice, but also confirm that the workload increases significantly in Year 2. Specific modules mentioned—NUH, CBB, and others in the Food and Nutrition course (FNC)—are highlighted as particularly demanding. While some comments express positivity and offer support to cope with the school's challenging workload, there are concerns about the quality of CBB's slides and the heavy time commitment of certain modules, like those in the FNC course.  The overall emotional tone is a mix of desperation, apprehension, and mutual support amongst students.

Concerns and Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management: The feedback suggests a need to review the curriculum and workload for Year 1 ASC students, particularly in the NUH and CBB modules.  The criticism of CBB's slide quality indicates a need for improvement in teaching materials.  Further investigation into the workload and time commitment required for modules in the FNC course is also needed.  A review of the balance between group projects and individual assessments may be beneficial to reduce student stress and promote a healthier learning environment.  In addition, exploring options to improve students' time management skills and provide additional support resources should be considered.
