The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss career paths in accounting and finance, specifically focusing on the potential of pursuing forensic accounting after completing a business diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster (OP) expresses uncertainty about salary expectations for forensic accountants and seeks advice on alternative high-paying, enjoyable jobs within business, finance, or accounting. They also explore the possibility of attending Temasek Junior College (TMJC) as a backup plan.

The overall sentiment is one of hopeful inquiry mixed with some anxiety regarding career prospects and salary expectations. The OP expresses genuine interest in business but also some uncertainty, while the commenter offers encouraging information about the earning potential of accountants who graduated from polytechnics, specifically mentioning a salary range of 6k-7k.  There is a positive leaning towards choosing a polytechnic education over junior college for faster entry into the workforce. No specific facilities or subjects within Temasek Polytechnic are directly discussed, though the business and accountancy & finance diplomas are implicitly referenced.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are not directly warranted based on this limited discussion. However,  it might be beneficial for the institution's career services department to provide clearer and more readily accessible information regarding average salary expectations for graduates from various diploma programs, particularly within the accounting and finance field. This could help address the OP's concerns and better inform prospective students making their educational choices.
