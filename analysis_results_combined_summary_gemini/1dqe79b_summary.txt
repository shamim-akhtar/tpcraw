The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the consequences of skipping compulsory extracurricular events at Temasek Polytechnic.  The central question revolves around the impact of non-attendance on a student's academic standing, specifically whether it affects their Grade Point Average (GPA), and the consensus points towards a potential impact on SEAL points instead.  Discussion also touches upon the perceived value and impact of having or lacking SEAL points in the current system.


The overall sentiment is a mixture of casual concern and cynicism.  While the original poster expresses worry about the repercussions of skipping a compulsory event, several commenters downplay the severity, suggesting widespread non-attendance.  The comments regarding SEAL points reveal a sense of disillusionment, with some believing that their value has diminished due to widespread attainment, highlighting a potential issue with the fairness or effectiveness of the SEAL points system.  There's no direct mention of specific school facilities, but the underlying concern relates to the school's policy regarding compulsory extracurricular activities and its reward system (SEAL points).


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include reviewing the effectiveness and perceived fairness of the SEAL points system. The widespread non-attendance of compulsory extracurricular events, as indicated by the comments, suggests a potential problem with either the events themselves, the perceived benefit of SEAL points, or both.  A review should be undertaken to assess whether the compulsory nature of these events is justifiable and whether the SEAL points system provides sufficient incentive for student participation while remaining equitable.  If the system is not achieving its intended goals,  re-evaluation and potential reform are recommended.
