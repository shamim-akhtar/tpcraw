The Reddit post and comments center on preparations for the Computer and Digital Forensics (CDF) diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster, a prospective Year 1 student with no prior computer experience, seeks advice on pre-enrollment preparation, including recommended apps and learning resources.  Comments offer a mix of advice on foundational computer literacy (file management, command line basics, safe downloading practices),  specific TP curriculum information (subjects like Python programming, cybersecurity fundamentals, and networking), and warnings about the difficulty of the CDF program.  Several commenters express concern about the lack of support for students entering with limited prior knowledge.

The overall sentiment is a mix of helpfulness and anxiety. While many commenters provide detailed advice and resources, a significant undercurrent of apprehension regarding the program's rigor and the perceived inadequate support for students without prior experience is apparent.  Specific mentions of the school involve criticisms of the curriculum's perceived lack of support for beginners and concerns about the difficulty of the CDF program, particularly in Year 2. Several comments highlight the importance of practical, hands-on learning, contrasting this with reliance on lectures and assessments.  The school's use of specific software (VirtualBox, Cisco Packet Tracer, Figma, Power BI, KNIME) is mentioned, along with the programming languages Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. The fear of AI-driven job displacement in the IT industry also features.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider addressing the concerns raised regarding the inadequate support for students entering the CDF program with limited prior computer knowledge.  Specifically, the curriculum's introductory material should be reviewed to ensure it effectively bridges the gap for such students.  This might include supplemental introductory materials or workshops focusing on fundamental digital literacy skills before the official start of the academic year.  Additionally, a review of the Year 1 curriculum and resources, particularly in relation to the Networking Technology (NECT) module, is recommended given the numerous comments indicating a lack of sufficient practical resources and teaching.  Finally, the comments concerning the high workload and difficulty of the CDF program, especially in Year 2, might suggest the need for improved support services, such as additional tutoring or mentorship opportunities, for struggling students.
