This Reddit thread centers on a Year 1 Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's concerns about preparing for their Computer and Digital Forensics (CDF) course, lacking prior computer experience.  Discussions cover preparatory steps, recommended software and skills (including Python, Linux, VMs, and command-line proficiency), the curriculum's structure across years 1 and 2, and concerns about the program's adequacy for students without prior computer knowledge.  Several students share their experiences and advice, with some expressing significant apprehension about the course's difficulty and the overall future of the IT industry.


The overall sentiment is a mix of anxiety and helpfulness.  While many commenters offer practical advice and resources (e.g., specific software, online tutorials),  a substantial undercurrent of pessimism surrounds the CDF program's perceived inadequacies, particularly for students lacking prior experience.  Concerns are raised about the steep learning curve, inadequate foundational preparation provided by the school, and a perceived lack of support.  Specific mentions include the school's use of software like VirtualBox and Python, and the difficulty of modules such as Networking Technology (NECT) and App Development and Database (ADEV & DBAV). The comments highlight a general feeling that self-learning and extra effort beyond the coursework are crucial for success, indicating a potential gap between the curriculum and the actual needs of students. The overall tone also includes some cynicism about the future of IT jobs due to the impact of generative AI.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the concerns regarding the preparedness of students entering the CDF program without a computer science background.  The comments suggest a need for a more comprehensive introductory course or pre-program preparation to equip students with fundamental computer literacy skills before they begin the specialized CDF curriculum.  Specifically, improving support for foundational technological skills (file management, command-line interface, basic software usage) should be a priority.  Further investigation into the challenges reported within specific modules like NECT and ADEV/DBAV is warranted, addressing resource scarcity and the difficulty students face.  Finally, the prevalent concern about the curriculum's alignment with the evolving IT landscape and the impact of generative AI should be considered and potentially reflected in curriculum updates.
