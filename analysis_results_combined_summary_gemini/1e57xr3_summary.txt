The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) applicant's desire to switch from the Product Experience and Design (PED) course, for which they have an interview, to Communication Design (CMD).  The main discussion revolves around the feasibility of requesting a course transfer during the interview, the competitiveness of both courses, especially CMD via Early Admission Exercise (EAE), and the applicant's chances of success given their choice of CMD as a third preference in EAE.


The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and cautious optimism. While users express doubt about the likelihood of a successful course switch after EAE,  they encourage honesty and transparency during the interview.  The comments highlight the intense competition for design courses, particularly CMD,  and the limited intake capacity of PED, mentioning it as a smaller course with high selectivity.  No direct negative comments about the school, facilities or specific lecturers were made; the focus remained on the admission process and course selection.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Given the comments regarding the highly competitive nature of design courses, particularly CMD, and the limited intake for PED, consider reviewing the EAE selection process for these courses. Explore options to provide more transparency about selection criteria and the weight given to course preference rankings.  Additionally,  assess the feasibility of allowing some flexibility for course transfers within the design school, perhaps providing a clearer communication pathway for applicants who demonstrate a genuine fit for a different design program after the initial application.  Increased clarity about the admission process for PED could alleviate applicant anxiety.
