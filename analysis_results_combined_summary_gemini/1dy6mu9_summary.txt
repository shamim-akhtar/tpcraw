The Reddit post and comments center on the experience of a prospective student applying for the Diploma in Business at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The main topics discussed are the content and format of the Aptitude Test (amplitude test), including the types of questions (math, riddles, English, and an open-ended question on business ethics), and the interview process, which includes questions about the applicant's interest in the diploma, reasons for choosing TP, relevant experience, and the ability to handle differing opinions.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and cautious optimism.  The commenter, Legitimate-Ad-7765, provides detailed information about their past experience, aiming to help the original poster prepare.  While the commenter acknowledges that the specifics might change, the information provided is positive and supportive, focusing on the practical aspects of the application process. No specific issues are raised regarding the school's facilities or overall reputation.  The description of the interview, while mentioning potentially challenging questions (naming an inspiring business person and illustrating conflict resolution), doesn't express negative feelings towards the process itself.


No specific recommendations for senior management are warranted based on the provided text. The comments offer a candid account of the application process, which can be valuable for prospective students, but do not reveal any systemic issues within Temasek Polytechnic requiring management intervention.
