The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's struggle with coursework in "PCMPd" and "CGMP," likely referring to specific modules within the Physics and or Chemistry related programs in their second year (Y2S2). The student seeks advice and tips from senior students in the same program, expressing confusion despite the subject matter seeming logically straightforward.  The comments are unfortunately absent, leaving the analysis limited to the original post.


The overall sentiment of the post is one of anxiety and frustration. The student expresses feeling overwhelmed and confused by the seemingly contradictory nature of the course material, despite acknowledging the potential for common-sense application within "CGMP". The emotional tone reveals a clear need for academic support and guidance. There's no direct mention of school facilities or overall school experience outside the specific academic challenges within the mentioned modules.


Given the limited information from the comments section, specific recommendations are impossible. However, the post highlights a potential need for improved learning resources or support structures for students struggling with specific, challenging modules.  Reviewing the teaching methodology and learning materials for PCMPd and CGMP within the Physics and/or Chemistry programs at TP would be beneficial to address the student's reported confusion.  This might involve clearer explanations of core concepts, more practical examples, and/or supplemental tutoring opportunities to ensure all students, particularly those in their second year, feel supported.
