The post seeks advice and experiences from previous interns, specifically asking about the RAC environment and a staff member with the initials OEH.  No comments are provided in the supplied text, so further analysis of comment content is impossible.

The overall sentiment of the post is one of anticipation and seeking information.  The author expresses both excitement about the internship at the RAC in the Engineering Block and a degree of apprehension, as evidenced by the request for advice and experiences (both positive and negative).

Without any comments to analyze, concrete recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management cannot be provided.  However, the post itself highlights the potential value of creating an online platform or resource for current and prospective interns to share their experiences at the various centers and facilities within the Polytechnic.  This could proactively address concerns and provide valuable insights to improve the internship program.
