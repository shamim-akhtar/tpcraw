The Reddit post and comments center on a student's question regarding attendance and medical certificates (MCs) at Temasek Polytechnic.  Specifically, the discussion focuses on whether attending class after submitting an MC for multiple days will override the MC record, and how the system handles the recording of both attendance and MCs.  Different opinions are offered on how the attendance system might function.


The overall sentiment is one of uncertainty and seeking clarification. The tone is generally helpful and collaborative, with users sharing their experiences and offering potential solutions, though acknowledging a lack of definitive knowledge.  There's no overtly negative sentiment towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, but the discussion highlights a potential area of confusion regarding the interaction between the attendance system and MC submissions. No specific facilities are mentioned.  


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management: The discussion reveals a potential lack of clarity or consistency in how the attendance system integrates with medical certificate submissions.  Students are unsure whether attending class while having a submitted MC for that day will be reflected correctly in their attendance records.  This uncertainty could cause unnecessary stress and potential administrative issues for students.  Senior management should review the system's functionality and consider improving communication to students about how MCs are processed and recorded in relation to attendance.  Clearer guidelines or FAQs regarding MC submissions and their impact on attendance records would alleviate student confusion and improve transparency.
