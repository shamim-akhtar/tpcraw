The Reddit post and comments center on the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) aptitude test for the Veterinary Technology course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster seeks advice on preparing for the test, prompting other users to share their experiences and insights.  These insights include the test's focus on sector knowledge and potential treatment-related questions, the importance of demonstrating strong interest and ethical considerations during the interview, and practical tips like reviewing online resources and the TP website. Several commenters also coordinate and share their interview experiences and anxieties.


The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and anticipation, particularly among those awaiting or having recently completed their interviews.  The tone is supportive and collaborative, with users offering encouragement and sharing information to help each other prepare.  Specific mentions include the Veterinary Technology course, the EAE aptitude test, the interview process, and the TP website as a resource.  The school's reputation and the perceived importance of the Veterinary Technology program are implicitly positive, as reflected in the high level of interest and effort put into the application process.


While there are no significant negative comments directed at Temasek Polytechnic,  a recommendation for senior management would be to improve the clarity and availability of information regarding the EAE aptitude test for the Veterinary Technology program.  The current reliance on word-of-mouth and user-generated content suggests a gap in official communication. Providing more specific details on the test format, content, and sample questions on the TP website could alleviate student anxiety and ensure a more transparent and equitable application process.
