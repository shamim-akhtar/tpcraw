The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of Year 2 students in the Pharmaceutical Science diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic. The original poster seeks information about the workload, specifically the amount of memorization required in Year 2, and requests advice for academic success.  The comments (which are absent from the provided data) would presumably offer responses to these questions, providing insights from senior students or alumni.


The overall sentiment of the original post is one of anxiety and apprehension about the upcoming challenges of Year 2.  The use of emoticons like "ðŸ¥¹" expresses nervousness and a desire for reassurance.  The questions about workload and memorization reveal a concern about the difficulty of the program.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities in the post itself;  any such mentions would be contained within the missing comment section.  The focus is entirely on the academic aspects of the Pharmaceutical Science program.


Without access to the comments section, specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management cannot be made.  However, if the comments reveal consistent concerns about excessive memorization or an unmanageable workload in Year 2 of the Pharmaceutical Science diploma,  management should investigate these claims.  This might involve reviewing the curriculum, providing additional support resources (such as tutoring or study skills workshops), and gathering feedback from students to identify areas for improvement in teaching methods and course structure.
