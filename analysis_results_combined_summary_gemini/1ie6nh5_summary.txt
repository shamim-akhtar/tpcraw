The Reddit post is a simple request for survey participation from a group of Temasek Polytechnic students conducting research.  The post itself provides a link to the survey and a plea for help, emphasizing the brevity of the survey (5 minutes maximum).  The comments section is empty, meaning there is no further discussion or feedback regarding the research or the polytechnic itself.

The overall sentiment is polite and appreciative. The students express gratitude for any assistance provided.  There is no negativity or criticism directed towards Temasek Polytechnic, its facilities, or its teaching staff.  Since no comments exist, there is no additional information or emotional tone expressed regarding the school.

Given the lack of comments and the purely solicitous nature of the post, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management arising from this Reddit thread.  The post is simply a request for research participation and does not provide any insights into the institution itself.
