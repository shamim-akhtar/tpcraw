The Reddit post and comments center on the difficulty of joining the Temasek Polytechnic (TP) football CCA (Co-Curricular Activity).  The main discussion revolves around the selection criteria, with several commenters emphasizing the significant advantage players with prior competitive experience possess.  The original poster inquired about the possibility of joining in April, and subsequently received an email from the CCA staff advisor confirming the emphasis on prior experience.

The overall sentiment is one of concern and slightly negative expectation regarding the chances of joining the TP football CCA without prior experience.  Commenters express a pessimistic outlook for those lacking a football background, while the staff advisor's email reinforces this sentiment.  There is a sense of disappointment and some frustration, particularly from the original poster, but also a pragmatic understanding of the competitive nature of the CCA. No direct negative comments regarding the school or its facilities are present; the focus is solely on the football CCA's selection process.

Based on the comments and the staff advisor's email, it's recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review the football CCA's selection criteria. While maintaining a competitive edge is understandable, the current emphasis on prior competitive experience may be excluding potentially talented students without such backgrounds.  A more inclusive approach, perhaps incorporating trials or alternative pathways for students to demonstrate their abilities, could broaden participation and foster a more inclusive sports culture within TP.  The current system seems overly restrictive and potentially discouraging to students interested in joining the CCA.
