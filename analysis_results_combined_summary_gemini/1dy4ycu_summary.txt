The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the aptitude test for the Fashion Management course at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster seeks information about the test's content and the interview process.  A commenter shares their experience from the previous year (when the application process was still ADM), describing the aptitude test as involving creative tasks such as naming a hypothetical fashion brand and designing clothes/bags using geometric shapes.  The commenter assures the original poster that the test is not overly stressful.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful. The commenter's response offers reassurance and practical advice to the original poster, alleviating anxiety about the upcoming aptitude test.  The tone is informal and supportive, with the commenter sharing their personal experience to provide clarity and encouragement.  The mention of  "colouring materials" (watercolours) suggests a practical and creative aspect to the aptitude test. There is no direct mention of school facilities, but the discussion implicitly relates to the course curriculum and assessment methods within the Fashion Management program.

While no major concerns are raised, it is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review the aptitude test format for the Fashion Management course to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness in selecting suitable candidates.  The feedback regarding the creative nature of the test, specifically the design task using geometric shapes, should be considered as valuable qualitative data for future test iterations.  Furthermore,  transparency about the test content, perhaps through a more detailed description on the polytechnic's website, could better prepare prospective students and reduce anxiety.
