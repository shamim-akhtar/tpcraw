The Reddit post and comments center on the grades for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAGG) assignment at Temasek Polytechnic.  Discussion revolves around the grade distribution (top 25% above 77%, remaining below 69%), student experiences with the assignment's difficulty and relevance to the course material, and the perceived unfairness of the grading scheme.  Specific concerns include the assignment's focus on irrelevant topics like digital diagram drawing, the weight of challenging questions, and the overall perceived difficulty compared to the students' expectations.

The overall sentiment is a mix of satisfaction (from students who achieved high grades) and significant frustration and disappointment (from those who didn't).  Many students express negative feelings towards the DSAGG assignment, describing it as overly lengthy, irrelevant to data structures, and unfairly weighted.  The comments reveal a sense of anxiety and concern surrounding the impact of the grades on their overall module grade.  Specific criticism is directed toward the assignment's design and the perceived disconnect between the assignment's content and the subject matter of the course. The school's online forum, Politemall, is mentioned as a resource used by students to compare answers, highlighting the lack of clarity or sufficient feedback from the educators.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

A review of the DSAGG module's curriculum and assignment design is warranted.  The feedback suggests a disconnect between the assignment's content and the core concepts of data structures.  Specifically, the complaints about the excessive focus on digital diagram drawing and the irrelevance of certain aspects need to be addressed.  The grading scheme should also be examined, considering the disproportionate impact of a few high-weighted questions.  Finally, the effectiveness of Politemall as a feedback mechanism should be evaluated, considering student complaints about the lack of clarity in feedback provided through the platform.  Increased clarity and more relevant assessments are vital to improving student learning and satisfaction.
