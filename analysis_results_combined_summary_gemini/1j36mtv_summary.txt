The Reddit post and comments center on the grades received for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAGG) assignment at Temasek Polytechnic.  Discussions revolve around individual student scores, the perceived difficulty and relevance of the assignment, particularly its focus on digital diagram creation rather than core data structures, and the impact of specific question weighting on final grades.  There's also some discussion on study strategies and comparing answers with feedback available online.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While some students express satisfaction with their grades (achieving A's), many express frustration and disappointment with the assignment's design and their scores.  The assignment itself is heavily criticized for being overly focused on "yapping" and digital diagrams, lacking relevance to core data structures, and containing a perceived trick question. The marking scheme is also criticized for heavily penalizing mistakes on higher-weighted questions.  Students are observed to have differing experiences, and the negative comments outweigh the positive ones. Specific comments focus on the "DSAGG" module, the assignment itself, and access to online feedback (politemall).

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the overwhelmingly negative feedback regarding the DSAGG assignment's design and relevance to the course content. The perceived disconnect between the assignment and core data structures, emphasized by multiple students, warrants a review of the curriculum and assessment methods.  The marking scheme's sensitivity to errors on high-weighted questions also needs consideration, as it disproportionately impacts student grades and contributes to negative sentiment.  Finally, investigating the accessibility and effectiveness of online feedback resources (politemall) could help improve student learning and reduce frustration.
