The Reddit post and comments primarily center on the application process for aerospace electronics engineering at Temasek Polytechnic.  Applicants are inquiring about the status of their applications and interviews, expressing anxiety and impatience due to the perceived slow pace of the admissions process.  Several commenters share their own experiences and attempt to reassure others.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty, with a slightly negative emotional tone stemming from the perceived slow response from Temasek Polytechnic's admissions department.  Commenters express impatience and frustration using emojis and phrases like "really slow man ðŸ˜”" and "I am still waiting after the test."  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities or subjects within the context of the application process. The comments primarily focus on the timing of the admissions process rather than the quality of the program or the school itself.

While no specific concerns about facilities or subjects within the program were raised, the slow response time regarding interview invitations and application statuses is a cause for concern.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the efficiency of their admissions process for aerospace electronics engineering.  Improved communication and transparency regarding application timelines, perhaps through regular updates or automated notifications, would likely alleviate applicant anxiety and enhance the overall applicant experience.
