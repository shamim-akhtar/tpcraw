The Reddit post and comments center around the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) interview process for the Psychology diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The author seeks to connect with others who have been shortlisted for the program, expressing a lack of communication within existing online groups. Several commenters indicate they've also been shortlisted and express interest in connecting with the original poster.  The timing of the shortlisting email is also discussed.

The overall sentiment is one of anxious anticipation and a desire for community amongst applicants.  There's a clear sense of uncertainty and a need for reassurance, as evidenced by the author's initial post and the numerous requests to connect privately.  The comments highlight a positive outcome for some applicants (shortlisting) but also reveal a lack of transparency or communication regarding the interview process itself,  primarily referencing the absence of information within the official Telegram group.  No direct comments regarding the school's facilities or other aspects beyond the interview process are made.

While the comments do not directly critique the school or its facilities, the lack of communication regarding the EAE process within the official Telegram group is a concern.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the communication strategies employed during the EAE process for the Psychology diploma.  Consider improving the transparency and frequency of updates provided to applicants, potentially through the official Telegram group or other communication channels, to alleviate anxiety and ensure applicants feel informed throughout the process.
