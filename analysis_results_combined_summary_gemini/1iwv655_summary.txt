The Reddit post and its comments center on the challenges faced by first-year students in the Information Technology (IIT) diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  A group of students created a Discord server to provide peer support and assistance with coursework, addressing perceived deficiencies in readily available academic resources.  The comments also touch upon broader issues, including student responsibility, lecturer support, the effectiveness of the school's support systems, and the process of securing internships.  A critical sentiment regarding the school's perceived inadequacy in helping struggling students is expressed by some, contrasted with others defending the institution's efforts and emphasizing student accountability.

The overall sentiment is mixed.  While there's appreciation for the initiative to create the Discord server, a significant portion of the comments express frustration and disappointment with various aspects of Temasek Polytechnic.  Negative comments focus on the perceived lack of sufficient support for struggling students, particularly in the IIT program, and the failure to secure promised internships.  Positive comments highlight the efforts of lecturers to assist students and emphasize the importance of student responsibility and proactive engagement in learning.  The school's facilities are not directly mentioned, but the lack of readily available support resources and the internship situation implicitly criticize aspects of the school's infrastructure and student support services.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The comments highlight a need for a review of support systems, particularly for first-year IIT students.  The difficulty in navigating course materials and accessing assistance points to a potential gap in the clarity and accessibility of support resources.  Additionally, the issue of promised internships not being fulfilled requires investigation and potential improvements to the internship placement process.  A more robust communication strategy regarding internship expectations and student responsibilities is warranted.  Finally, while lecturers' efforts are lauded, evaluating the consistency of support across the faculty could help ensure all students receive the appropriate level of guidance.
