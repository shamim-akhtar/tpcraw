The Reddit post announces a student-led survey aiming to improve awareness and usage of Temasek Polytechnic's library resources, services, and facilities.  The survey is part of a Guided Learning project, and the students are promoting it via the post and social media links to their Instagram and TikTok accounts.  The comments section is missing from the provided data, therefore no comment analysis can be done.


The overall sentiment expressed in the post is positive and proactive. The students demonstrate initiative and a desire to improve the student experience regarding the TP library.  The language used is polite and encouraging, aiming to garner participation in their survey.  The subjects are specifically the library's resources, services, and facilities. No specific facilities are mentioned beyond the general reference to the library itself.


Given the absence of comments, no specific concerns or recommendations can be provided to Temasek Polytechnic's senior management at this time.  The post itself indicates a positive student-led initiative that could be beneficial to the library and the student body.  Further analysis would be possible with the inclusion of the comments section.
