The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the difficulty of a Business Law mid-semester test (MST) at Temasek Polytechnic.  The author expresses concern about the test's difficulty, and a commenter agrees, attributing their poor performance to insufficient study and the test's focus on obscure terminology.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and frustration. The commenter explicitly mentions struggling with the exam due to a lack of preparation and the unexpected emphasis on specific, less common terms within the course material.  There's a sense of shared experience and commiseration regarding the difficulty of the Business Law MST. No specific school facilities are mentioned, but the discussion centers around the content and structure of the exam itself, indirectly reflecting on the teaching methods or curriculum design.

Recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should include a review of the Business Law MST's question design.  The comments suggest that the test disproportionately focused on less frequently used terms, potentially indicating a mismatch between exam expectations and the course's emphasis.  A review of the curriculum and assessment design for this course, including the weighting of different topics within the exam, is warranted to ensure fairness and effective evaluation of student learning.  Feedback from students, gathered through surveys or focus groups, could inform this review.
