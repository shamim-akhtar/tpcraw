The Reddit post and comments center on the question of whether Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) students at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) are required to attend two separate orientations: one specifically for PFP students and another for all Year 1 freshmen.  The confusion stems from conflicting information observed on TP's online orientation schedule.  The comments clarify that only attending the PFP-specific orientation is necessary.

The overall sentiment is one of mild confusion and seeking clarification regarding orientation schedules. The tone is generally helpful and informative, with commenters providing clear answers to the original poster's question. There is no overt negativity directed toward Temasek Polytechnic, its facilities, or its administration. The discussion primarily focuses on the practical issue of orientation attendance for PFP students, making use of the abbreviation "ori" as shorthand for orientation.


No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management arise from this post and its comments. The issue highlighted is a minor logistical question easily resolved through clarifying communication regarding orientation schedules for PFP students.  Potentially, reviewing the online orientation information for clarity and consistency could prevent future similar confusion.
