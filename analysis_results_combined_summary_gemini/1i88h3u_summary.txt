The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's inquiry about joining the school's hockey team.  The author, having prior floorball experience, seeks advice on team competitiveness and strategies for securing a place on the team.  The lack of comments indicates a limited discussion surrounding the hockey team specifically, and no broader opinions about the school are expressed.

The overall sentiment is one of anticipation and mild apprehension.  The author expresses excitement about starting school in April but also a degree of uncertainty regarding their chances of making the hockey team, given their lack of prior hockey experience.  There is no mention of specific school facilities, subjects, or broader aspects of TP beyond the hockey team.

Given the limited information, no specific recommendations for senior management are warranted at this time.  The post focuses solely on a student's interest in a specific extracurricular activity and doesn't provide insight into broader issues affecting the school or its facilities.
