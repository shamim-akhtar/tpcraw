The Reddit post and comments center on the competitiveness of joining a sports CCA (Co-Curricular Activity), specifically table tennis and badminton, at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students are expressing concerns about the selection process and the need for prior experience to be considered for trials.  Several commenters highlight the stringent selection criteria and the low likelihood of acceptance without prior competitive experience.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty among prospective students.  The emotional tone is predominantly negative, with expressions of disappointment, worry, and resignation.  The comments reveal a perception of highly competitive sports CCAs at Temasek Polytechnic, with some suggesting the selection process is overly strict.  Specific CCAs mentioned are table tennis and badminton, which are portrayed as particularly difficult to join without prior experience. No direct comments were made about specific school facilities or aspects of the school, but the implications suggest existing CCAs are popular, and possibly oversubscribed.

Recommendation for Senior Management:  The high level of competitiveness and perceived strictness of the selection process for popular sports CCAs like table tennis and badminton should be reviewed.  Consider revising the selection criteria or increasing the capacity of these CCAs to provide more opportunities for students who may lack prior competitive experience but demonstrate potential and enthusiasm. This could mitigate the negative sentiments expressed by prospective students and improve the overall student experience.  Transparency regarding the selection process and criteria would also alleviate student anxieties.
