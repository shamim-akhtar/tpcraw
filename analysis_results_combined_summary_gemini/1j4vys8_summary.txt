The Reddit post and comments center on the question of whether a student entering the Computer Engineering course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) should purchase a tablet for accessing course materials and completing assignments.  Discussions revolve around the accessibility of online course materials, the suitability of tablets versus laptops for coursework, and the recommended specifications for computing devices by the TP engineering department.  Specific concerns about the weight of physical notes and the compatibility of tablets with lockdown browser software for online assessments are also raised.


The overall sentiment is generally positive towards using a tablet for accessing course materials, especially given the weight of physical notes mentioned by one commenter.  However, there's a degree of caution expressed regarding the suitability of a tablet for all aspects of coursework, with one commenter suggesting laptops are better for completing assignments. The comments reflect a helpful and informative community, guiding the original poster towards finding the right solution based on individual course requirements and access to online learning resources.  No negative sentiment towards the school, facilities, or specific professors is expressed.


Based on the comments, I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review the weight of physical course materials provided to Computer Engineering students.  If deemed necessary, explore options for lighter, more environmentally friendly alternatives, or increase emphasis on the availability and accessibility of digital course materials. Additionally, ensure that the recommended specifications for computing devices, available on the TP website, are clearly communicated to prospective students and that this information is readily accessible and up-to-date.  The ease of compatibility of tablets with lockdown browser software for online assessments, as mentioned by one commenter, should also be explicitly addressed and clarified on the course webpage.
