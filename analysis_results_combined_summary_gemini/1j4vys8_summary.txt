The Reddit post and comments center on the practicality of using a tablet for a Computer Engineering student at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster is considering purchasing a tablet for accessing online course materials and completing assignments while traveling.  Comments offer varying perspectives, suggesting checking the Polytechnic's website for recommended specifications, noting the suitability of tablets for lecture materials but not necessarily for all coursework, and highlighting the weight of physical notes as a potential reason for tablet usage.

The overall sentiment is positive towards tablet use, particularly for accessing lecture notes and online materials.  There is a consensus that checking the specific course webpage for recommended hardware is crucial.  While some commenters mention iPads specifically as a good investment, there's no strong negative sentiment expressed towards the school or its facilities.  However, one commenter notes the weight of physical course notes as a significant drawback.  The discussion focuses on the practical aspects of choosing a device for studying, not on broader issues related to Temasek Polytechnic itself.


A recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management would be to improve the accessibility of information regarding recommended device specifications for each course. While the comments suggest the information is available on the website, making it more prominently featured and easier to navigate could enhance student experience and reduce confusion.  Additionally, exploring options to reduce the weight and physical bulk of course materials (e.g., increased reliance on digital notes and reducing the necessity of physical textbooks) could address the concern raised regarding heavy physical notes.
