The Reddit post and comments center on the choice between two engineering electives at Temasek Polytechnic: Internet of Things (IOT) and Advanced System Programming (ASP).  The primary discussion revolves around the perceived workload and difficulty of ASP, with one commenter strongly advising against it due to its impact on free time.  There is limited information provided regarding the specifics of each elective's curriculum or content.

The overall sentiment is predominantly negative towards the ASP elective.  The comments express concern about its workload and potential impact on students' personal lives.  While there is curiosity about the IOT elective, no negative opinions are voiced. There is no direct discussion about school facilities or the school itself beyond the context of the electives being offered within Temasek Polytechnic's engineering curriculum.

Based on the limited information,  I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management investigate the student perception of the ASP elective's workload.  Anonymous student feedback surveys could provide more detailed insights into the reasons behind the negative sentiment.  This data could inform potential curriculum adjustments or support systems to mitigate the excessive workload concerns raised by students.  Further investigation into the comparative difficulty of both IOT and ASP electives could also be beneficial to ensure a balanced elective selection process for students.
