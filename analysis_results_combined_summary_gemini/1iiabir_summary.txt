The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Accountancy and Finance (A&F) student's inquiry about balancing a part-time internship with their upcoming studies.  The student received an internship offer requiring two days a week, 9-5, and sought advice on whether this is feasible given the unknown class schedule.  A commenter provided insight into the typical first-year A&F schedule at TP, suggesting limited free days might make the full internship duration difficult.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and practicality. The commenter offers advice based on personal experience and knowledge of the TP A&F program's demanding schedule.  While there is no negative sentiment towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, the commenter's description of the first-year A&F schedule highlights a potential challenge for students balancing work and studies.  The lack of free days in the first year, a characteristic of the A&F program, is mentioned as a significant factor to consider. No specific facilities or aspects of the school are discussed.

Recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic are not explicitly warranted by this exchange. However, the comment regarding the lack of free days in the first year for A&F students might indirectly suggest a review of the program's scheduling to better accommodate students' potential need for part-time employment.  This could involve exploring alternative scheduling models or increased flexibility to allow students to better balance academic work and practical experience.
