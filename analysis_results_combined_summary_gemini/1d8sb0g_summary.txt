The Reddit post and comments center around the elective selection process for senior students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster inquires about the method of selecting elective clusters – whether it's a ranked preference system or a simple top choice selection – and whether GPA or a first-come, first-served (FCFS) system influences the outcome.  The length of the selection process is also questioned.

The overall sentiment is one of anxious anticipation and mild uncertainty.  The original poster expresses concern about the lack of clarity regarding the elective selection process. The comments (which are absent from the provided data) would presumably offer experiences and insights from previous students.  No specific subjects, school facilities, or aspects of the school beyond the elective selection process itself are mentioned in the provided text.

Without the content of the comments, specific recommendations are impossible. However, if the comments reflect a similar concern about the lack of transparency and a potentially stressful FCFS system, a recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic senior management would be to review and improve the elective selection process.  This could involve clarifying the selection method (ranked preferences versus top choice), providing more detailed information to students beforehand, and possibly exploring alternative methods that are less stressful and more equitable.  Transparency and clear communication regarding the criteria (GPA, FCFS, etc.) are key to alleviate student anxiety.
