The Reddit post and comments center on the eligibility criteria for the polytechnic tuition grant in Singapore.  The original poster (OP), a Permanent Resident (PR), is concerned that their parents' high income (above $20,000) will disqualify them from receiving the grant.  The comments, however, refute this, asserting that parental income is not a determining factor.

The overall sentiment is one of reassurance and clarification.  The comments attempt to alleviate the OP's anxiety and provide accurate information regarding the grant application process. While the school itself isn't directly discussed, the comments indirectly address the accessibility of the grant, suggesting a focus on supporting students regardless of family income.  There is no mention of specific school facilities or subjects.

While no specific concerns are raised regarding Temasek Polytechnic's management, it is recommended that the institution review its communication strategies surrounding financial aid.  The confusion expressed by the OP highlights a potential need for clearer and more accessible information regarding tuition grant eligibility criteria on the school's website or through other official channels.  This would prevent similar anxieties from arising in future applicants.
