The Reddit post is a student's plea for participants in a math project survey, using a Google Forms link.  The primary issue discussed in the comments is the potential risk of the link being malicious, raising concerns about security and data privacy.  The post itself doesn't directly address Temasek Polytechnic beyond being posted on its subreddit.


The overall sentiment is one of caution and skepticism regarding the provided link.  The comment expresses worry about potential hacking and malicious intent, creating a negative emotional tone. There is no direct mention of Temasek Polytechnic's facilities, teaching staff, or other aspects of the school in either the post or the comment.


Given the single comment highlighting security concerns,  Temasek Polytechnic's senior management should consider providing students with clear guidelines and resources on creating secure online surveys for academic projects.  This should include educating students on best practices for data protection and identifying potentially harmful links.  Further,  consider establishing a system for review of student-created online surveys before dissemination to minimize potential security risks.
