The Reddit post and comments center around a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's concern about missing a COMT exam due to illness. The student, a Year 1 student in the School of Informatics and Digital Technologies (School of IIT), missed the exam and submitted a Medical Certificate (MC) through TP's online system (TPOSS).  The main discussion revolves around whether a warning letter will be issued despite the MC, the procedure for submitting the MC, and the possibility of a retest.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and worry from the original poster, quickly followed by reassurance from other commenters.  While the initial tone is panicked and pleading for help ("PLEAAAASSEEüôèüôèüò≠"),  the subsequent comments offer calm advice and support.  Specific mentions of TP include the TPOSS system for submitting MCs and the School of IIT (implied through the student's reference to "cdf"). No specific facilities are mentioned, but the discussion highlights the process for handling student absences and missed exams.  One commenter describes their experience in the same school ("yr 2 in cdf") as positive. Another commenter uses a negative term to describe the school ("It's hell").

For senior management at Temasek Polytechnic, the comments highlight a potential communication gap. While the TPOSS system seems functional, the student's anxiety suggests a lack of clarity regarding the process for submitting MCs and the potential consequences of missing exams.  Consider improving communication around MC submission procedures, perhaps through clearer online instructions or more proactive communication from lecturers/instructors to alleviate student anxieties.  Also, investigate the negative comment ("It's hell") to understand the source of the student's dissatisfaction and potential areas for improvement in the student experience.
