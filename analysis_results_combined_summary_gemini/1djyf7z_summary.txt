The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concern about verifying a tuition fee payment made via AXS.  The student questions whether the online portal accurately reflects the payment and seeks alternative methods to confirm successful payment.  Comments offer suggestions to check the payment status within the school's internal system (TP OEI SharePoint) and advise patience due to potential system update delays.

The overall sentiment is one of mild concern and uncertainty, but generally positive and helpful. The student expresses anxiety about the discrepancy between their payment confirmation and the outstanding balance shown online. However, the comments offer reassuring advice and practical solutions. The comments refer to the school's online payment system, the internal system TP OEI (Sharepoint), and implicitly to the school's financial department. No specific facilities or other aspects of the school are mentioned beyond these systems.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The incident highlights a potential usability issue with the online fee payment system.  The lag between payment processing and system update could cause unnecessary anxiety for students.  Senior management should investigate the delay and explore improving the system's real-time update functionality or provide clearer communication to students regarding expected processing times.  Additionally,  reviewing and improving the clarity of instructions for checking payment status via alternative methods like the TP OEI SharePoint system may also enhance student experience.
