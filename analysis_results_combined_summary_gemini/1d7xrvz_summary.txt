The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Year 1 Applied Science (ASC) student's consideration of dropping a mathematics-related subject (MAS).  The main discussion points revolve around the impact of dropping a subject on the student's Grade Point Average (GPA), the feasibility of dropping the subject, and advice from other students on how to manage academic challenges.  Several commenters emphasize the importance of maintaining a strong foundational GPA in Year 1 for future academic success.


The overall sentiment is one of support and concern for the student's academic well-being.  While there's a recognition of the difficulty of the MAS subject and the student's struggles, the prevailing tone is encouraging and advisory, urging the student to persevere and aim for at least a passing grade. The comments highlight the perceived difficulty of certain modules within the ASC school, particularly the mathematical content within MAS.  There is also a mention of the school's academic support resources, though not explicitly.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  The comments highlight student struggles with the MAS module within the Applied Science school.  Senior management should review the curriculum and pedagogy of this module to assess whether it appropriately supports student learning, particularly given the apparent challenges it presents to a significant number of students.  The comments also suggest a need for readily accessible and well-publicized academic support resources, possibly including peer mentoring programs or improved tutoring services, to help students struggling with challenging modules like MAS.  More proactive guidance concerning the implications of dropping modules on future academic prospects would be beneficial.
