The Reddit post and its single comment center around a prospective Temasek Polytechnic student in the Veterinary Technology course seeking advice from current students.  The original poster (OP) requests direct messages (DMs) from seniors to ask questions about the program.  The only comment is a confirmation of a DM sent to the OP.

The overall sentiment is positive and helpful. While no specific opinions on the school, its facilities, or the Veterinary Technology program are expressed in the post or comment, the willingness of a current student to provide information suggests a generally supportive atmosphere among students.  The brief interaction lacks the detail needed to assess broader student opinion on any specific aspect of Temasek Polytechnic.

No specific concerns or recommendations for senior management are warranted based on this limited interaction.  More data is needed to assess the overall student experience, satisfaction with facilities, or the quality of the Veterinary Technology program.
