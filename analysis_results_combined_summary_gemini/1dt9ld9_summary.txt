The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) attendance policy, specifically focusing on the impact of medical certificates (MCs) and absences on module attendance and potential penalties.  Users inquire about the consequences of having one MC and one absence in a semester, leading to a discussion about the maximum permissible absences before disciplinary action is taken.  The evolving strictness of TP's attendance policy is also a central theme.

The overall sentiment is one of concern and apprehension regarding TP's increasingly stringent attendance policy. While the initial question is posed neutrally, subsequent comments reveal anxiety about potential repercussions for exceeding the allowable number of absences, even with MCs.  There's a sense of uncertainty about the exact thresholds and consequences, particularly regarding the deduction of Course Participation (CP) marks.  The mention of TP's increased monitoring and investigation of students with numerous MCs adds to the negative tone.  No specific facilities are mentioned, but the discussion centers around the impact of attendance policies on students' academic standing within the school.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Given the expressed student concerns regarding the updated attendance policy, particularly the deduction of CP marks for excessive absences regardless of MCs, a review of the policy's clarity and fairness is recommended.  Students appear confused about the exact number of permissible absences and the consequences of exceeding the limit, especially when MCs are involved.  Greater transparency regarding the policy's implementation and the processes for investigating attendance issues would alleviate student anxiety and ensure fair treatment.  Consider providing clearer communication on the policy, potentially including FAQs and updated information disseminated through official channels. The potential for unintended negative consequences due to increased strictness should also be reviewed.
