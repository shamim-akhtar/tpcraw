The Reddit post and comments center on the schedule of Year 1, Semester 2 for the Accountancy & Finance (ADM) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The original poster seeks information from senior students about the typical weekly schedule, specifically inquiring about the frequency of Fridays free from classes and how the four modules are distributed throughout the week.  This is driven by the need to reconcile their part-time job schedule with their academic commitments.


The overall sentiment is one of polite inquiry and a desire for practical advice. The tone is anxious and slightly apprehensive, reflecting the poster's concern about balancing work and studies.  There are no negative comments about the school, its facilities, or its programs mentioned in the provided information;  the focus remains entirely on the scheduling aspects of the ADM curriculum.


Given the limited information provided, no specific concerns or recommendations for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic can be formulated.  The post highlights a student's need for better access to information regarding typical module scheduling for their course. Perhaps providing more detailed course information and sample schedules online could alleviate similar anxieties for future students.
