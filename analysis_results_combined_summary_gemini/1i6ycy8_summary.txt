The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Information Technology (IIT) student's recommendation to use ESLint, a code linting tool, for their Application Development (ADEV) project.  The author provides step-by-step instructions for installation and configuration, addressing common student errors and subsequently updating the configuration to resolve compatibility issues.  Additional comments suggest the use of the Prettier plugin for code formatting and highlight the lack of Git instruction in the curriculum.

The overall sentiment is helpful and supportive, aiming to improve the code quality and reduce errors for fellow students.  The author expresses concern over students encountering common coding errors due to a lack of readily available tools.  The positive sentiment is reinforced by the Subject Leader's approval of ESLint, suggesting institutional support for improved coding practices.  The comments highlight the lack of Git instruction as a significant gap in the current curriculum.  No direct criticism of the school's facilities is mentioned, though the indirect criticism focuses on the curriculum's lack of essential tools for modern software development.

**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

Given the student's initiative and the positive reception to the ESLint recommendation, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider integrating ESLint and similar tools into the IIT ADEV curriculum.  Furthermore, a critical review of the curriculum's lack of Git instruction is warranted.  Incorporating version control systems like Git into the syllabus would significantly improve students' development skills and prepare them better for industry standards.  The lack of these essential tools, while addressed by student initiative in this instance, may hinder learning outcomes and create a knowledge gap for all students, not just those proactive enough to seek out these tools independently.
