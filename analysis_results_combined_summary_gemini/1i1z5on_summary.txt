The Reddit post and comments center on student dissatisfaction with the organization and pacing of certain courses (ADEV/DBAV, NECT) within the Information and Internet Technology (IIT) school at Temasek Polytechnic, specifically targeting Year 1 students.  The author proposes a collective effort to submit consistent feedback through the school's Tessy system, aiming for a significant impact on course planning and organization for future semesters.  The comments discuss alternative methods for feedback collection (Google Forms) but ultimately support the organized approach proposed in the post.

The overall sentiment is one of frustration and dissatisfaction with the quality of instruction and course planning in specific IIT courses.  The emotional tone is proactive and collaborative, focusing on finding a solution through collective action.  The school's Tessy feedback system is central to the discussion, while specific courses (ADEV/DBAV, NECT) within the IIT school are directly criticized for being rushed and poorly planned. No specific facilities are mentioned.

**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

Given the expressed student concerns regarding the courses ADEV/DBAV and NECT within the IIT school, a review of the curriculum structure and teaching methodologies for these courses is recommended. This review should include a thorough analysis of student feedback gathered through the Tessy system, paying close attention to the consistency and frequency of negative comments about pacing and planning.  Consider implementing mechanisms for more regular and informal student feedback collection throughout the semester, rather than relying solely on the end-of-semester Tessy evaluations.  This proactive approach can facilitate timely adjustments to teaching strategies and course content.
