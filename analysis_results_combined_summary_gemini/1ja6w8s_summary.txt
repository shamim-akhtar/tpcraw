The Reddit post and comments center on a first-year Temasek Polytechnic student's inquiry about joining the basketball CCA (Co-curricular Activity), despite being overweight and lacking competitive experience.  The comments largely advise the student to prepare for rigorous tryouts, emphasizing the competitive nature of the CCA and the likely preference for players with prior experience and better physical fitness.  The student also expresses concern about their height.

The overall sentiment is cautiously encouraging but realistic. While comments acknowledge the student's interest and suggest trying out, they also highlight the challenges they'll face due to their physique and lack of competitive experience. The emotional tone is a mixture of helpfulness and pragmatism, with a degree of apprehension regarding the student's chances of making the team.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities, but the comments imply a level of competitiveness suggesting adequate facilities for basketball training exist.


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The comments suggest a potential need for more inclusive CCA tryout processes. While prior experience is valuable, rigidly excluding students based solely on fitness level or competitive history may be counterproductive to fostering participation and inclusivity within the school's extracurricular programs.  Consider reviewing the CCA selection criteria to ensure they balance competitive standards with opportunities for students of all skill levels and physical conditions to participate and develop their abilities.  Promoting a welcoming environment for newcomers to CCAâ€™s, regardless of their prior experience, would improve the overall school atmosphere and enhance student satisfaction.
