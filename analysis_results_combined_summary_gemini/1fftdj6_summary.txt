The Reddit post is an advertisement by a recent Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Aerospace Engineering and Logistics (AEL) graduate offering private tutoring services for aerospace and engineering modules.  The accompanying comment thread briefly touches upon the perceived difficulty of subsequent semesters in the AEL course.

The overall sentiment is neutral. The post itself promotes a service and maintains a professional tone.  The comment thread expresses a student's concern about increasing academic difficulty, with the tutor responding in a somewhat reassuring, albeit generalized manner. There is no overtly positive or negative sentiment expressed towards the school, its facilities, or specific modules beyond the implied difficulty of the AEL course.  No specific facilities or aspects of the school are mentioned.

While no immediate concerns are raised, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider proactively addressing student anxieties regarding increasing academic workload and module difficulty.  Perhaps providing additional support mechanisms, such as supplemental tutoring programs or improved academic advising, could help alleviate stress and improve student success rates, particularly within the AEL course.  This could also potentially decrease the demand for private tutoring services.
