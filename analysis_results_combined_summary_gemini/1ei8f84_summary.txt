The Reddit post and comments center on the curriculum of the Common ICT (Information and Communications Technology) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic, specifically focusing on the subjects offered in the second semester of the first year.  The main inquiries revolve around the content, software used, and the overall difficulty of subjects like Application Development Project (ADEV), Database Application Project, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAG), and Network Cloud Technology (NECT).  Several comments share experiences and provide advice on tackling the workload and achieving good grades.

The overall sentiment is generally positive, with many describing the second semester as "chill" or "relatively more chill" compared to the first.  However, there's a clear understanding that "chill" doesn't equate to effortless success.  While several commenters highlight the manageable workload, they emphasize the importance of consistent effort to achieve high grades. The comments mention specific software like HTML, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and Cisco's learning lab tools used in the subjects. Several commenters praise the use of AWS (Amazon Web Services) in the curriculum and suggest preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam as a way to gain a significant advantage.  There is no explicit negative feedback about school facilities.


Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Based on the positive feedback regarding the integration of AWS into the curriculum, consider expanding the use of industry-relevant software and certifications across other programs.  The success of students who prepared for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam suggests a valuable approach to enhancing student learning and employability.  Further investigation into the possibility of incorporating similar industry-recognized certifications into other modules could benefit students across various specializations.  Finally, while the second semester is perceived as easier, ensure that sufficient support systems are in place for students who struggle, especially considering the combined assignments that could lead to disproportionately high or low marks depending on individual strengths.
