The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's inquiry about the rugby CCA.  The original post seeks insights and opinions on the rugby club from current or former students.  No comments are provided, therefore, there is no further discussion regarding the club, facilities, or other aspects of TP.

The overall sentiment is positive and inquisitive. The original poster expresses interest and a willingness to join the rugby CCA.  The lack of comments prevents any further analysis of the sentiment regarding the rugby club, the school's facilities related to it (such as fields or equipment), or any other aspect of Temasek Polytechnic.

Given the absence of comments, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management based on this post and its comment section.  Further analysis would be needed if more user feedback were available.
