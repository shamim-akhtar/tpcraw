The Reddit post and comments center on the Business Data Analytics (BDA) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main discussion revolves around the curriculum for Year 2, specifically which modules will be offered and what those modules entail.  Students are seeking information about the content and software used in courses like Quantitative Analysis, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning for Decision Making, along with questions regarding the integration of business concepts and portfolio-building opportunities within the program.


The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and curiosity.  Different_Dot_5762 provides a detailed, informative response to the original poster's question, displaying a positive and supportive attitude.  Antique_Childhood489 expresses interest in the business aspects of the program and the possibility of portfolio development, indicating a desire for practical application and career preparation.  The tone is generally positive, with some underlying concern regarding the variability of the curriculum from year to year, but no overt negativity towards the school or its facilities is expressed.  The mention of specific software (Alteryx, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, SAS Enterprise Miner, Tableau) suggests that the program is well-equipped in terms of technological resources.


Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management:  To address the variability in the BDA curriculum,  consider publishing a more detailed and consistent course outline well in advance of each academic year.  This would alleviate student anxiety and allow for better planning.  Additionally, while the comments mention the inclusion of business concepts,  explicitly stating the extent of business-related coursework in the official program description would enhance transparency and attract prospective students interested in that aspect of data analytics.  Finally, exploring opportunities to more formally integrate portfolio-building projects or community engagement activities within the BDA curriculum would further enhance the practical skills and career readiness of graduates.
