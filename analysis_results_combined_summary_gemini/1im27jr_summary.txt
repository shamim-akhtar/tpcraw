The Reddit post and comments center on student anxiety and preparation for upcoming DSAG and ADEV DBAV tests at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students express significant difficulty understanding the material, seek advice on study strategies, and inquire about the test format and content.  Some comments offer practical advice, like utilizing available mock quizzes and independent research, while others express frustration and a lack of confidence.

The overall sentiment is one of stress, anxiety, and desperation. Students express feelings of being "cooked" and overwhelmed.  The lack of a code editor is mentioned as a significant concern.  While some comments offer helpful suggestions, the prevailing tone is negative, reflecting a lack of preparedness and a perceived inadequacy of support resources.  The school's facilities or specific aspects of the courses (DSAG and ADEV DBAV) are not directly criticized, but the comments imply a gap between student understanding and the resources provided. The ironic comment suggesting simply stating "I love ADEV DBAV" highlights the students' frustration and perceived disconnect with the curriculum.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the perceived lack of readily available support resources for students struggling with DSAG and ADEV DBAV.  The comments suggest students feel unprepared and are resorting to asking for last-minute solutions rather than engaging proactively with the course material.  A review of the course structure, teaching methods, and the availability of supplementary learning resources (e.g., better integration of code editors into the learning environment) may be warranted to better support student learning and reduce pre-exam stress.  The recurring nature of similar requests for help might indicate a systematic issue requiring investigation.
