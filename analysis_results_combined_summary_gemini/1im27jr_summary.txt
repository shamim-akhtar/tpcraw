The Reddit post and comments center around student anxieties regarding upcoming exams in the DSAG and ADEV DBAV modules at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students are seeking advice on how to prepare, expressing significant stress and a lack of understanding of the course material.  Comments offer limited direct help, instead focusing on general study advice like self-reliance and utilizing available resources such as mock quizzes.  The lack of readily available study resources is also implicitly highlighted.

The overall sentiment is one of high stress and anxiety among students.  The emotional tone is overwhelmingly negative, filled with expressions of desperation and frustration ("so cooked," "the death of me," "ðŸ˜­").  While no specific facilities are mentioned, the implicit criticism lies in the perceived lack of sufficient support and readily available resources to aid in exam preparation. The lack of a code editor is specifically mentioned as a problem by one commenter.  The course material itself (DSAG and ADEV DBAV) is referenced as being difficult to understand.  One comment suggests a cynical approach, highlighting a potential issue with assessment methods.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the accessibility and sufficiency of learning resources available to students preparing for DSAG and ADEV DBAV exams.  The comments suggest a potential gap in support, evidenced by students feeling overwhelmed and resorting to seeking help on Reddit instead of utilizing readily available institutional resources.  Specifically, the lack of a code editor mentioned by one student should be addressed, and the overall effectiveness of the exam preparation materials and support systems should be reviewed.  The suggestion that previous years' quizzes closely mirrored subsequent ones raises concerns about the potential for exam predictability and might warrant a review of assessment practices.
