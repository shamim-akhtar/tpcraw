The Reddit post is a plea for participation in a survey regarding traditional heritage, created by Temasek Polytechnic students facing a looming project deadline ("getting cooked by PFP," likely referring to a project failure point).  The students offer "5 years good luck" as an incentive to complete the short survey. The post itself doesn't discuss specific issues related to Temasek Polytechnic itself.


The overall sentiment is one of desperation and a playful attempt to garner assistance. The emotional tone is light-hearted, albeit stressed,  with the "5 years good luck" adding a humorous element to their plea for help. There is no direct mention of the school's facilities, teaching staff, or specific subjects beyond the project focusing on traditional heritage.


No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted based solely on this post and comments.  The post highlights student stress related to a project, which is a common occurrence in higher education, but doesn't indicate systemic issues within the institution.
