The Reddit post and comments center on a Year 1 student in the Physical and Sports Science (PHS) course at Temasek Polytechnic seeking study materials, specifically slides and notes, from Year 2 and 3 students to prepare for the upcoming year.  The student expresses concern about the large volume of content in the course.  There are no other comments present to add further discussion.

The overall sentiment is one of anxious preparedness and hopeful anticipation. The student expresses nervousness about the upcoming year and a proactive desire to succeed. The emotional tone is positive and polite, seeking help from the community.  The only specific mention related to the school is the PHS course and its perceived heavy workload. No specific facilities are mentioned.

Given the lack of further comments or complaints, there are no specific recommendations for senior management at this time. However, the student's concern about the substantial workload in the PHS Year 2 curriculum might warrant a review by the department to ensure that the course structure and delivery effectively support student learning and alleviate undue stress.  This could involve evaluating the amount of material covered, providing additional support resources, or optimizing learning strategies.
