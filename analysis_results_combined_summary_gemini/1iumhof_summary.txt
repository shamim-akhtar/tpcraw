The Reddit post and its comments center on a Year 1 student in the Physical and Sports Science (PHS) course at Temasek Polytechnic seeking study materials – specifically slides and notes – from Year 2 and 3 students to prepare for the upcoming academic year.  The request highlights student concerns about the substantial workload and the desire to be proactive in their studies.


The overall sentiment is one of polite request and anxious anticipation.  The student expresses a positive outlook, using emojis to convey enthusiasm and gratitude, but underlying this is a palpable sense of pressure and concern regarding the difficulty of the PHS curriculum in Year 2. There is no direct mention of specific school facilities or the school itself, beyond the implicit reference to the PHS course structure and its demanding nature.


While there are no direct criticisms of Temasek Polytechnic, the student's request implicitly suggests a perceived need for more proactive support materials or resources for students transitioning between years.  A potential recommendation for senior management might be to explore creating and providing officially sanctioned preparatory materials for students moving from Year 1 to Year 2 in the PHS course, potentially including sample notes or study guides. This could help alleviate student anxiety and improve the overall learning experience.  The success of such an initiative could be measured by assessing student performance and satisfaction levels in subsequent years.
