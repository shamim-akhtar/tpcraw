The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's negative experience with a consultancy internship arranged by the school.  Key issues discussed include low pay despite long working hours and unpaid overtime, poor management, lack of mentorship and guidance, unclear project assignments leading to wasted effort, and the difficulty in obtaining compensation for extra work.  Several commenters share similar experiences or offer advice regarding internship selection and navigating such situations.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, with the author expressing frustration, exhaustion, and disappointment with their internship experience.  The emotional tone is one of bitterness and disillusionment.  The post specifically criticizes the consultancy company's management style, the lack of support from the TP liaison officer, and the inadequate pay compared to the workload.  Comments reflect a mix of sympathy, shared negative experiences, and cautionary advice.  Several commenters mention difficulties with finding suitable internships, highlighting the challenges TP students face in securing fulfilling and appropriately compensated placements.  One commenter details a vastly different experience, however, suggesting a significant degree of variability in internship quality.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the concerns raised regarding the quality and support provided for student internships.  Specifically, they need to review the processes for matching students with internships, ensuring that the advertised minimum pay aligns with the actual compensation students receive, and addressing the apparent lack of oversight regarding working conditions and compensation for overtime.  The lack of effective liaison support for students struggling with exploitative internships is also a significant concern, suggesting a need for improved support structures and clearer communication about students' rights and recourse options.  The significant discrepancy between positive and negative experiences suggests a need to further standardize the internship selection and oversight processes.
