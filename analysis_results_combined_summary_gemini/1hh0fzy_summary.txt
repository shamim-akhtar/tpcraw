The Reddit post and comments center on the difficulties students in the ADEV/DBAV (likely Application Development/Database Administration and Visualization) diploma at Temasek Polytechnic are experiencing with Assignment 2.  The assignment requires creating a full-stack website, a task students feel is inadequately prepared for given the limited time spent on relevant coursework, particularly JavaScript and server-side scripting.  Students express confusion regarding the correlation between lab exercises and assignment specifications, and debate the optimal approach to starting the project (backend first vs. frontend design).

The overall sentiment is one of frustration, stress, and overwhelm.  Students express feeling unprepared and under-supported by the pace and depth of instruction.  The comments reveal a perceived disconnect between the curriculum's coverage of JavaScript and full-stack development and the assignment's expectations.  The lab materials are criticized for their lack of relevance to the assignment.  There's also a hint of resignation and humor ("they focused on killing us first"), reflecting the students' shared struggle.  The school's facilities (labs and provided materials) are indirectly criticized for their inadequacy in supporting the assignment.  There is also a student who mentions knowing React (a JavaScript framework), highlighting potential mismatches between prior student knowledge and the polytechnic curriculum's focus.


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management include the pacing and depth of the ADEV/DBAV curriculum, particularly regarding the introduction and application of JavaScript and server-side scripting. The disconnect between lab exercises and assignment requirements needs immediate attention.  A review of the curriculum's alignment with assignment expectations is recommended, possibly incorporating more practical application exercises and better integration between lab work and assignments.  The effectiveness of lab demo videos should also be evaluated to ensure their clarity and relevance to the assignment specifications.  Finally, evaluating the curriculum's progression and ensuring it properly leverages studentsâ€™ prior knowledge (like React) would further enhance learning.
