The Reddit post and its comments primarily discuss paranormal experiences and purported ghost stories associated with Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) design school.  Several commenters share anecdotal accounts of unusual occurrences, including disappearing stationery, a supposedly summoned entity ("xiao ming"), and the chaining of mannequins.  One commenter refutes the existence of such phenomena, while another shares a story from the Stirling Road campus with no paranormal activity reported.


The overall sentiment is lighthearted and somewhat skeptical. While some commenters express a sense of eeriness or belief in the stories,  the tone is largely playful and anecdotal rather than genuinely fearful.  The mentions of the design school and its facilities (studios, mannequins) are central to the narratives, with the disappearance of stationery in studios being a recurring theme.  The older Stirling Road campus is also briefly mentioned, but without any related paranormal accounts.


Recommendations for senior management are not strictly warranted given the nature of the discussion. However, if the management wishes to address the anecdotal accounts of missing stationery in the design studios,  a simple internal communication reminding students to be mindful of their belongings, and perhaps providing improved storage solutions, could mitigate any potential issues.  This would address the concerns without necessarily validating the paranormal explanations.
