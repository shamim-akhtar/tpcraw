The Reddit post and comments center on the competitiveness of the Common Design Programme (CDP) at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) and anxieties experienced by a newly accepted student regarding their artistic abilities.  The original poster expresses concern about their lack of perceived artistic talent and potential impact on their GPA.  A commenter offers encouraging advice focusing on thorough research and preparation, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive work for presentations. Another commenter simply shares their own acceptance into the CDP program.

The overall sentiment is one of apprehension and uncertainty mixed with a degree of supportive encouragement. The original poster expresses anxiety and self-doubt about their artistic skills and ability to succeed in the CDP. The commenter’s advice, while helpful, doesn’t directly alleviate these concerns. The mention of the CDP program itself evokes a sense of both excitement (from the commenter’s shared acceptance) and apprehension (from the original poster's fear of not keeping up).  No specific facilities or aspects of the school beyond the CDP program are discussed.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Consider implementing pre-semester workshops or introductory sessions for newly accepted CDP students to ease anxieties and provide practical guidance on navigating the program.  These sessions could address common concerns about artistic skill levels, fostering a supportive learning environment and offering strategies for success.  Focusing on practical application and effective research techniques, as suggested by the commenter, could also form a core component of these introductory sessions.
