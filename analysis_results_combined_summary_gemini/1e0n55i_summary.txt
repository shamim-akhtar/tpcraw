The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student's plea for help with their Year 2 Data Visualization project. The project involves using KNIME and Tableau software to create a report and dashboard, and the student is seeking assistance due to a tight deadline.  The comments offer assistance and clarify the project's technical aspects, focusing on the software used.

The overall sentiment is one of urgency and desperation from the original poster, Gwenlover3000, who expresses their stress about the impending deadline. The comments are generally helpful and supportive, offering assistance and clarifying the project's scope. There is no direct mention of Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or school-related issues beyond the context of a student's coursework.  The tone is informal and friendly.


No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are warranted based on this Reddit thread. The post highlights a student struggling with a project deadline, but this is not indicative of a systemic issue within the school's curriculum or support services.
