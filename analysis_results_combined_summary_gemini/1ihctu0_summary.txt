The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the Accountancy and Finance (A&F) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The main issues raised include concerns about the student body's behavior, specifically mentioning instances of drama, social media posting habits, and even a potential case of sexual assault.  Academically, the comments highlight the demanding nature of the course, emphasizing the importance of a strong mathematical foundation and consistent effort.  Group project dynamics and the resulting interpersonal conflicts are also a significant point of concern.

The overall sentiment is largely negative, with a strong undercurrent of anxiety and apprehension.  The commenter expresses disdain for the behavior of some A&F students, focusing on their social media presence and tendency towards drama. The mention of a potential sexual assault case further contributes to a negative and unsettling tone.  While acknowledging the existence of "decent" students, the overwhelming impression is one of social toxicity within the A&F cohort.  There is also a sense of foreboding from the original poster regarding their upcoming experience.  No specific facilities are mentioned, but the comments highlight concerns about the program's academic rigor and the social dynamics within the student body.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Given the serious allegations of a sexual assault and the pervasive reports of social conflict and drama within the A&F program, an immediate investigation into these matters is warranted.  This should include measures to prevent future occurrences, such as improved student support services, clearer guidelines on acceptable student conduct, and perhaps mandatory training on conflict resolution and respectful social interaction.  Furthermore,  reviewing the curriculum and support systems to better prepare students for the mathematical demands of the A&F program might help alleviate some academic pressures contributing to student stress and potentially negative social behaviors.  Finally, a thorough assessment of group project dynamics and the implementation of alternative approaches could mitigate the interpersonal conflicts described in the comments.
