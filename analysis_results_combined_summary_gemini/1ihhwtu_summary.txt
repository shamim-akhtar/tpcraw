The Reddit post and comments center on a student's unsuccessful attempt to appeal their posting to Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Common Science course, desiring instead to attend Singapore Polytechnic's (SP) Common Science course. The student, having achieved a raw score of 11 and a net score of 9, sought help navigating the TP appeal process via the school's website, believing it to be more successful than the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) appeal website.  The comments (which are absent from the provided data) would presumably offer advice or share experiences related to the appeal process.

The overall sentiment expressed in the post is one of frustration and anxiety. The student clearly expresses strong desire to attend SP, highlighting their disappointment with the TP posting.  The emotional tone is negative, characterized by worry and desperation ("i rlly want to get into sp common sci ðŸ˜­").  The subject of the appeal process itself, specifically the difficulty in navigating TP's website, is a major point of concern.  There is also implicit negative sentiment towards TP as the preferred choice (SP) was not allocated.  No specific mentions of TP facilities are present in the provided text.

Based on the limited information, I recommend senior management at TP review the accessibility and user-friendliness of their online appeal system. The student's experience suggests potential improvements are needed to ensure the appeal process is clear, straightforward, and accessible to all applicants.  The website's design and navigation should be thoroughly evaluated to identify and address any usability issues that might hinder successful submission of appeals.  Further investigation is needed to gather feedback from the students who experienced difficulty using the system.
