The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the aptitude test for the Aviation Management Early Admission Exercise (EAE) at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students share their experiences with the test, including the number of questions, time constraints, and the types of questions asked (pattern recognition and basic math).  The focus is on preparing prospective students for the test by providing insights into its format and difficulty.


The overall sentiment is positive and helpful. While some students express concern about the time limit (mentioning not finishing the test), the overall tone is encouraging, with one student sharing their successful experience despite not completing all the questions.  There is a collaborative spirit, with students sharing information and offering support to those preparing for the EAE.  No specific criticisms of the school, facilities, or teachers are mentioned; the conversation centers solely around the aptitude test itself.


No specific recommendations for senior management are warranted based on this Reddit thread. The comments offer valuable information from students' perspectives, potentially assisting in refining the EAE process or providing clearer expectations to prospective students.  However, no significant issues were raised that require immediate action from Temasek Polytechnic's leadership.
