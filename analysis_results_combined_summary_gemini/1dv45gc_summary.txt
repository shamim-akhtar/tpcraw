The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the dress code and accessibility of Temasek Polytechnic's gym.  Users inquire about the required attire (specifically whether regular clothes are acceptable), the necessity of booking, and the gym's operating hours, noting closures for CCA activities.  Concerns about potential overcrowding are also raised, and users offer advice on less busy times to visit.

The overall sentiment is predominantly helpful and informative.  While the original poster expresses some inconvenience regarding the potential need for specific gym attire, the responses are generally supportive and provide clear guidance on gym policies.  The comments focus on practical aspects such as the dress code (requiring athletic wear, sports shoes, and a towel), the need for a Matrix card, and the pre-entry gym test.  There's a slightly anxious tone in the original poster's questions about overcrowding and gym closures, which is then addressed by positive and reassuring responses.  No negative sentiment is expressed towards the school, its facilities, or staff.

Based on the user's inquiries, Temasek Polytechnic's senior management might consider reviewing the clarity of their gym policies regarding dress codes and operating hours.  A more readily accessible online resource outlining the gym rules (including dress code, booking procedures, required equipment, and CCA closure schedules) could alleviate student confusion and enhance the overall user experience.  Additionally, while the comments suggest overcrowding isn't a major issue, exploring options to further optimize gym usage during peak hours might improve user satisfaction and manage potential crowding in the future.
