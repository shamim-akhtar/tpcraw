The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's questions regarding the Medical Biotechnology diploma.  Specifically, the student inquires about necessary pre-enrollment preparation in math, chemistry, and biology; the weighting of tests, exams, and projects in GPA calculation; and the environment and requirements of various Clubs and Societies (CCAs).  Current students provide advice on course content, exam structures, and CCA experiences.

The overall sentiment is helpful and supportive, with a prevailing positive tone towards most aspects of TP.  Current students offer encouraging advice and share personal experiences.  While some anxiety is expressed regarding the difficulty of certain modules, like the Mathematics in Applied Science (MAS) module, the comments generally convey a sense of community and willingness to assist.  The student's concerns about academic preparedness are addressed directly, and the descriptions of CCAs like Toastmasters are overwhelmingly positive.  No significant negative feedback is directed towards the school's facilities or overall learning environment.

Based on the student's concerns and the comments, the following recommendation is offered to Temasek Polytechnic's senior management:  Consider providing more detailed information for prospective students on the specific mathematics content required for the MAS module within the Medical Biotechnology diploma, particularly for students without prior advanced mathematics.  A clearer breakdown of assessment weighting for different modules across different diploma programs would also be beneficial.  Further, consider showcasing the breadth of CCA opportunities and their individual requirements more comprehensively on the TP website, supplementing the existing information with student testimonials or videos.
