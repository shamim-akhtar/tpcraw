The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Medical Biotech (MBT) student's questions about the course.  The main topics discussed include the availability of overseas trips and other opportunities (camps, festivities, Learning Journeys),  the use of technology for note-taking, lecturer quality, the differences between Year 1 and Year 2, typical timetables, lab hours and grading, project frequency, class size, and advice for incoming students.  A significant portion of the discussion details the experiences of a current MBT student.


The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and helpful. The current student (Middle-Complaint9127) expresses enthusiasm for the program and their lecturers, describing them as passionate and supportive.  While the workload is acknowledged as demanding, particularly the jump from Year 1 to Year 2, the challenges are framed within a positive context.  The detailed responses showcase a strong sense of community and willingness to assist incoming students.  Specific mentions of facilities include labs (with varying hours and project-based grading), and the use of technology like iPads and note-taking apps. Overseas trips, though requiring self-funding, are highlighted as a significant opportunity.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider the following:  The comments highlight the significant cost of MBT-specific overseas trips, potentially creating inequitable access for students from less privileged backgrounds.  The variability in timetables, partly due to tutor availability and student needs, could be addressed by improving tutor-to-student ratios or optimizing scheduling to minimize disruption.  The substantial workload increase between Year 1 and Year 2 warrants review to ensure a smoother transition and better support for students.  Finally,  proactively disseminating information about opportunities like overseas trips, camps, and the LEAD programme via clearer communication channels (beyond MSTeams and email) is recommended to ensure all students have equal access.
