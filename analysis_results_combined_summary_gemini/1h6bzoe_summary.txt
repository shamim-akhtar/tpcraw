The Reddit post and comments center on the poor hygiene and condition of the male toilets at Temasek Polytechnic.  Specific complaints include a lack of ventilation leading to strong odors of urine and feces, urinals being positioned too close to sinks, and general uncleanliness stemming from students' improper toilet etiquette, such as failing to flush and leaving behind excessive toilet paper.  The comments also touch upon the disparity in cleanliness between male and female restrooms, with the female toilets also receiving criticism, although to a lesser extent.


The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disgust and frustration with the state of the male toilets.  The tone is critical, bordering on angry,  especially regarding the male students' hygiene practices.  While some comments express empathy for the cleaning staff, the predominant emotion is one of dissatisfaction with the school's facilities and the behavior of a significant portion of the student body.  The school's image and standards are implicitly called into question given the described state of the toilets.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the recurring complaints regarding the male restrooms urgently.  Specific recommendations include investigating and improving ventilation in the male toilets to mitigate odor issues.  Furthermore, a targeted campaign addressing proper toilet etiquette, including flushing, aiming correctly, and cleaning up after oneself, should be implemented.  This campaign should specifically target male students and could involve awareness posters, announcements, and possibly even incentives for good hygiene.  Finally, an assessment of the layout of the male restrooms, specifically the proximity of urinals to sinks, should be conducted to determine if redesigning specific areas is warranted.  Addressing the issues in the female restrooms, as highlighted by some commenters, should also be investigated and addressed.
