The Reddit post and comments center on the competitiveness of joining a volleyball CCA (Co-curricular Activity) at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) for a prospective student with a performing arts background in secondary school.  The main concern is whether prior secondary school CCA experience outweighs external club experience, with several commenters suggesting that TP's sports CCAs, particularly volleyball (TPVB), are highly selective and prioritize students with strong prior sports experience.

The overall sentiment is a mix of apprehension and hope.  Commenters express the intense competitiveness of TPVB and other sports CCAs, creating an anxious tone for the original poster.  There's a degree of pessimism regarding the chances of acceptance given the lack of relevant secondary school CCA experience. However, other commenters offer encouragement, suggesting that trying out for the trials is still worthwhile, and highlighting that club experience and demonstrable skill might still sway the selection process.  The facilities or specific aspects of the school itself are not directly discussed, but the competitiveness implied reflects upon the overall perceived quality and popularity of TP's sports program.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The comments suggest a review of the CCA selection process for sports, particularly volleyball.  The perception that secondary school CCA experience significantly outweighs external club experience and demonstrated skill could be detrimental to attracting talented students from diverse backgrounds.  Consider revising the selection criteria to give more weight to demonstrated skill and aptitude, potentially supplementing the process with more transparent information regarding the criteria used for selection and reducing the emphasis on solely secondary school CCA participation.  This could create a more inclusive and equitable environment, fostering a greater diversity of talent within TP's sports CCAs.
