The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student's inability to connect their laptop to the school's Wi-Fi network, despite their phone connecting successfully.  The student has tried various troubleshooting steps, including restarting their laptop, forgetting and re-entering the Wi-Fi password, and system troubleshooting, all without success.  Other students offer suggestions, including restarting the laptop and checking for network outages,  but ultimately the issue remains unresolved.  The student mentions experiencing the problem in the engineering block and the library.

The overall sentiment is one of frustration and concern from the student, who is experiencing a significant disruption to their ability to use school resources.  The comments express a mix of helpfulness and empathy, with other students offering suggestions based on their own experiences with the school Wi-Fi. While there is no overt negativity towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, the persistent Wi-Fi issue highlights a potential problem with the school's network infrastructure, specifically impacting the connectivity in at least the engineering block and library.  There is no direct mention of other school facilities or subjects affected.

It is recommended that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management investigate the reported Wi-Fi connectivity issues in the engineering block and library. The persistent problem experienced by the student, despite various troubleshooting attempts, suggests a potential underlying network problem that may impact other students. A review of the network infrastructure in these areas, potentially including router configurations and bandwidth allocation, is warranted to ensure reliable Wi-Fi access for all students.  Further investigation should determine if this is an isolated incident or a wider problem impacting other students and locations.
