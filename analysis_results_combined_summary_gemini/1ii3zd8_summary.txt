The Reddit post and comments center on the frustrations of Temasek Polytechnic students dealing with irresponsible group project partners.  Many students describe experiences with teammates who procrastinate excessively, contribute minimally, or outright refuse to participate, leaving the diligent students to carry the workload.  The discussion highlights the pressure of GPA, the perceived inadequacy of reporting these issues to lecturers, and the prevalence of this problem across different courses and years of study, particularly in CICT and Innova projects.  Several commenters share coping mechanisms, including forming study cliques and employing strategic methods to incentivize participation from less motivated peers.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration, anger, resentment, and exhaustion.  The emotional tone is highly stressed, reflecting the pressure students feel to succeed academically despite the actions of their group members.  The school itself is not directly criticized, but the implicit critique lies in the apparent lack of effective solutions to address the issue of irresponsible group project participation.  Courses like CICT and Innova are specifically mentioned, implying the problem is not isolated to a single program. There is also a sense of resigned acceptance amongst some, with comments highlighting the need to "tahan" (endure) or acknowledging that this behavior is common in future workplaces.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider addressing the recurring problem of unproductive group dynamics in projects.  Specifically, investigating whether the current assessment methods inadvertently incentivize free-riding behaviors. Exploring alternative project structures, such as individual components with clear weightings or peer evaluations, could be considered to mitigate the disproportionate burden on diligent students.  Additionally, offering workshops or resources on effective teamwork and conflict resolution could help equip students with the skills to navigate such challenging group dynamics more successfully. The repeated mention of CICT and Innova suggests that these programs could benefit from a review of their group project assignments.
