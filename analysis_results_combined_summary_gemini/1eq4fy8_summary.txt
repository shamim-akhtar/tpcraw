The Reddit post and comments center on the overwhelmingly negative student experiences with the final two questions of a COMT (likely a computing or computer technology module) exam at Temasek Polytechnic.  Students describe the questions as excessively difficult, time-consuming, and poorly worded, leading to widespread failure and significant distress.  Concerns regarding inconsistent invigilation practices, unclear marking schemes, and a lack of moderation or bell curve application are also raised.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, expressing frustration, anger, and despair.  Students use terms like "cooked," "roasted," and "dead" to describe their performance.  The emotional tone is highly charged, reflecting significant student dissatisfaction with the COMT exam, specifically its difficulty and the perceived unfairness of the assessment.  Mentions of the school's handling of the situation (lack of moderation, inconsistent invigilation), as well as the specific challenges of the Python programming questions and the inadequate time allocation, are prominent.  Concerns about the functionality of the lockdown browser are also highlighted.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the following:

1. **COMT Exam Design and Assessment:** The difficulty and time constraints of the final two questions of the COMT exam need immediate review.  The feedback suggests the exam was inappropriately challenging for the allotted time, leading to widespread student failure.  A thorough analysis of the questions, including their clarity and feasibility within the time limit, is crucial.  Consider implementing a more robust moderation process or bell curve to mitigate the impact of extremely difficult questions.

2. **Invigilation Practices:**  The inconsistencies reported by students regarding invigilation procedures (e.g., conflicting instructions about screenshotting the lockdown browser) require immediate attention.  Standardized training and clear guidelines for invigilators are essential to ensure fairness and consistency across all exams.

3. **Lockdown Browser Functionality:** The reported issues with the lockdown browser, including freezing and potential data loss, raise serious concerns about the reliability of the software used for assessment.  An investigation into these issues and potential alternative solutions is warranted.

4. **Student Feedback Mechanisms:**  The fact that students felt compelled to write a formal report to Mr. Tan Hong Yap highlights a potential deficiency in the existing student feedback mechanisms.  More accessible and responsive channels for addressing student concerns should be implemented.
