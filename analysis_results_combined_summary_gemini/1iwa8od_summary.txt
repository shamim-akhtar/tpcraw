The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the curriculum of the Year 1 Common ICT course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster seeks information about the course content, and a commenter provides a detailed overview including topics such as basic networking, user interface design, programming (Python, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL), data analytics, and computer mathematics.  A significant point raised is the lack of introductory computer skills training within the curriculum.

The overall sentiment is a mixture of helpfulness and concern.  The commenter provides a comprehensive and seemingly positive overview of the course content, effectively answering the original poster's question. However, the concern regarding the absence of introductory computer skills training for students with no prior experience carries a negative undertone, expressing frustration with the curriculum's omission and uncertainty about whether changes will be implemented.  The commenter specifically mentions the lack of basic Windows usage instruction as a significant deficiency impacting students without prior computing knowledge. This highlights a potential shortcoming in the support provided for students with varying levels of prior experience with IT.

For senior management at Temasek Polytechnic, it is recommended to review the Year 1 Common ICT curriculum to address the identified lack of introductory computer skills training.  Specifically, the absence of instruction on basic Windows functionalities should be examined.  Considering the commenter's feedback and the potential difficulties faced by students without prior computing experience, incorporating a module covering fundamental computer usage and operating system navigation would significantly benefit students and improve the overall learning experience. This would ensure that all students, regardless of their prior knowledge, have a solid foundation to build upon.
