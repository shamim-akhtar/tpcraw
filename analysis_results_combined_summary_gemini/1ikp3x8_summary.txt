The Reddit post and comments center around a single user, SuccotashPlus9948, seeking information about the Law course at Temasek Polytechnic.  The post itself is brief, simply requesting that current students in the Law program contact them privately with answers to their questions.  No other substantive discussion occurs in the comments section.

The overall sentiment is neutral. The post expresses a need for information but doesn't convey any positive or negative opinions about Temasek Polytechnic, its Law program, or any specific facilities or aspects of the school. The lack of comments prevents any further analysis of sentiment towards the institution.

Given the limited content, no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management can be offered. The post highlights a potential student's need for information, implying a possible gap in readily accessible information regarding the Law program, but this requires further investigation to determine if it's a systemic issue.  More engagement with prospective students on platforms like Reddit could be beneficial.
