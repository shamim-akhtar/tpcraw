The Reddit post and comments center on a student's desire to transfer courses at Temasek Polytechnic due to dissatisfaction with their current program.  The main topic is the process of appealing for a course transfer, specifically the likelihood of success and the steps involved.  The post seeks advice and experiences from other students who have undergone a similar process.


The overall sentiment is anxious and apprehensive. The original poster expresses significant unhappiness with their current course, highlighting a strong negative feeling.  There is a lack of comments, so no other opinions on the school, its facilities, or specific courses are available. The absence of further comments prevents a broader analysis of sentiment towards Temasek Polytechnic itself.


Given the limited information provided, specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are difficult to formulate. However, the single post highlights a potential area for improvement:  clarifying and potentially streamlining the course transfer appeal process.  Providing more accessible and transparent information about success rates and the appeal procedure could alleviate student anxiety and improve the overall student experience.  Perhaps creating a dedicated FAQ or informational resource on the school website would be beneficial.
