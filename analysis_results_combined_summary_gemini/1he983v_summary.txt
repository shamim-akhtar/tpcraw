The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student's concern about potential expulsion.  The student, a second-year student, engaged in sexual activity with a minor (a 15-year-old girl) whom he mistakenly believed to be his age.  The discussion focuses on the potential consequences of this action, particularly if the girl's older sister reports the incident.  Commenters express disbelief, judgment, and concern for the potential legal and disciplinary ramifications.

The overall sentiment is one of shock, disbelief, and condemnation of the student's actions.  The comments overwhelmingly express negative judgment towards the student for his failure to ascertain the girl's age before engaging in sexual activity.  There is a mention of the "engineering block" where the encounter occurred, but no other school facilities or specific aspects of the school are discussed. The emotional tone is primarily one of disgust and concern, with a mix of disbelief and anger expressed by commenters.  One commenter lightly suggests a potential for school suspension.

Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  While this incident is primarily a matter of legal and ethical concern rather than a direct reflection on the school's facilities or programs, the incident highlights the need for improved sexual health education and awareness programs for students.  This includes explicit information about consent, age of consent laws, and the importance of verifying a partner's age before engaging in sexual activity. The university should consider workshops or online resources that address these critical issues in a clear and accessible manner.  This proactive approach could help prevent similar incidents in the future and create a safer campus environment.
