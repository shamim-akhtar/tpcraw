The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's concern about applying for the Marketing course as their first choice.  The student's L1R4 net score meets the 2024 cutoff point, but they are worried about potential changes to the cutoff point (COP) for 2025.  The discussion focuses on the likelihood of the COP dropping and the student's chances of securing a place in the Marketing course.  The commenter offers reassurance and advice about applying and including backup choices.

The overall sentiment is positive and reassuring. The commenter provides supportive and encouraging advice, conveying a helpful and optimistic tone.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities or subjects other than the Marketing course itself. The anxiety of the original poster is palpable, focusing on the uncertainty surrounding the changing COP and the implications for their course selection.  The helpful commenter focuses on alleviating this anxiety with advice.

While there are no direct concerns regarding the school's facilities or management, a recommendation for the senior management of Temasek Polytechnic would be to proactively and clearly communicate the COP for each course well in advance of the application deadline.  This would reduce student anxiety surrounding the application process, as evidenced by the original poster's concern about the potential fluctuation of the COP from year to year.  Transparency about the COP and any potential adjustments would improve the applicant experience.
