The Reddit post and comments center around an incoming Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Engineering student's anxieties about Engineering Math and seeking advice on navigating orientation week and the overall workload.  Specific concerns include the difficulty of Engineering Math, particularly for students without prior A-Math experience, and the quality of lecturers.  Comments offer reassurance, highlighting the availability of support programs like supplementary lessons and LSP, and generally positive experiences with lecturers.

The overall sentiment is predominantly positive and supportive.  While the original poster expresses anxiety about Engineering Math and the workload, the comments offer encouragement and practical advice.  The comments portray the lecturers in a favorable light, describing them as "nice" and dedicated to helping students.  Positive experiences with the school's learning support systems, such as supplementary lessons and the LSP program, are also mentioned. No negative comments regarding school facilities were present.

While no major concerns are raised, it might be beneficial for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management to consider proactively promoting the availability and effectiveness of support programs like supplementary lessons and the LSP (Learning Support Program) to incoming students. This could alleviate anxieties around challenging subjects like Engineering Math and ensure all students, regardless of their prior academic background, feel adequately supported.  A clear communication strategy emphasizing the availability of these resources during orientation week would be particularly impactful.
