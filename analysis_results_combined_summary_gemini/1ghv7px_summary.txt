The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss internship pay rates for business school students at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main focus is on the average salary range offered to interns, with specific figures cited, and a brief mention of whether or not leave is included in the compensation.  There's also a (quickly dismissed) query about the names of companies offering internships.

The overall sentiment is neutral and inquisitive.  The original poster expresses simple curiosity about internship compensation. The comments provide factual information, offering a salary range (600-1000 SGD) and noting exceptions where higher pay with paid leave is possible. There is no overtly negative or positive emotional tone expressed towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, its facilities, or any specific programs. The focus remains solely on financial aspects of internships.


No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted based on this limited discussion. The post and comments simply reflect students' interest in a practical aspect of their education – compensation during internships – and do not highlight any systemic issues within the school or its programs.
