The Reddit post and comments center on the lack of communication from Temasek Polytechnic's Early Admission Exercise (EAE) regarding aptitude test invitations for prospective students.  Several applicants, particularly those from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) stream applying for the Aviation Management course, express concern over not receiving emails, while others who applied from the O-level stream have already received theirs.  The uncertainty around the timeframe for receiving emails and the lack of clarity on the notification process for unsuccessful applicants are major points of discussion.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty.  Applicants express feelings of worry, panic, and frustration due to the lack of communication from the Polytechnic.  The comments reveal a perceived disparity in communication timelines between ITE and O-level applicants, creating further concern. The School of Engineering is mentioned positively, as it contacted applicants for GPA information, but the lack of EAE communication is the primary focus, creating a negative perception of the admission process for certain applicants.  Specific courses mentioned include Aviation Management, Digital Film and Television. No specific facility issues were discussed.

**Recommendations for Senior Management:**

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review and improve communication surrounding the EAE process. The disparate experience between ITE and O-level applicants regarding email notifications needs immediate attention.  Transparency is crucial; clarifying the timeline for sending out aptitude test invitations, and importantly, the process for informing unsuccessful applicants, is vital to alleviate student anxiety and improve the overall application experience.  Consider sending a blanket email to all applicants, regardless of outcome, within a defined timeframe to provide closure and clear expectations.
