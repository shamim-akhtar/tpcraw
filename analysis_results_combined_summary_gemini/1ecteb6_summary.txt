The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) applicant's anxiety about an upcoming Early Admission Exercise (EAE) interview for an Aerospace Engineering course.  The applicant lacks direct experience with airplane modules or technology achievements and seeks advice on crafting a portfolio and presenting themselves confidently during the online interview.  The comments offer guidance on how to highlight relevant experiences, even indirect ones such as watching aviation-related films or visiting aviation museums, and emphasize the importance of confident body language and a positive first impression.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and reassurance.  While the initial post expresses anxiety and a lack of relevant experience, the comments provide constructive suggestions and alleviate the applicant's concerns. The comments emphasize the importance of showcasing personal qualities and aspirations, rather than solely focusing on technical achievements.  There's a supportive tone in guiding the applicant to present themselves confidently during the interview, focusing on body language and positive first impressions. No negative comments are directed towards the school, its facilities, or the EAE process itself.

No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted based on this Reddit thread. The discussion focuses solely on an individual applicant's preparation for an interview and doesn't reveal any systemic issues within the school's admissions process or curriculum.
