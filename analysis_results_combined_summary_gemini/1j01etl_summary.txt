The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the career prospects of Cybersecurity Diploma in Further Education (CDF) students from Temasek Polytechnic, specifically focusing on whether graduates plan to stay in Singapore or pursue opportunities abroad.  The conversation centers on the comparative advantages and disadvantages of working in Singapore versus other countries like the US and Europe, highlighting factors such as salary, work-life balance, career growth potential, and networking opportunities.

The overall sentiment is relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards pragmatism. While Asleep_Market1202 acknowledges the stability and networking benefits of working in Singapore, particularly within government and finance, they also emphasize the higher salaries and faster career progression available internationally.  There is no direct mention of Temasek Polytechnic's facilities or specific aspects of the school's curriculum in this particular thread; the focus is entirely on post-graduation career choices.

No specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are warranted based on this limited discussion.  The comments pertain to external factors influencing career choices after graduation, rather than any shortcomings or improvements needed within the Polytechnic itself.  The conversation highlights the importance of preparing students for global career opportunities and providing them with the skills and experience to compete internationally, but doesn't offer actionable suggestions for the institution.
