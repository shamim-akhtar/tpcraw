The Reddit post and comments center on the upcoming Business Law exam at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster expresses anxiety about the limited practice questions provided and the application of the IRAC method.  Commenters share their study strategies, emphasizing familiarity with legal principles and the location of information in the open-book exam,  debating the practical application of IRAC, and revealing the exam format includes multiple-choice, open-ended questions, and a crossword puzzle. One commenter boasts a distinction grade.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety mixed with a pragmatic approach to exam preparation. While the original poster expresses considerable stress ("so confused," "ðŸ˜­"), the comments offer reassurance and practical advice.  The open-book nature of the exam is highlighted, shifting the focus from rote memorization to efficient information retrieval.  There's a humorous element in the discussion of IRAC's practical relevance and the inclusion of a crossword puzzle in the exam.  No specific criticisms of the school, its facilities, or teaching staff are mentioned, though there is implicit critique of the limited practice questions available.

While no direct concerns about the school are raised,  the limited number of practice questions (only four) provided for the Business Law exam could warrant attention from senior management.  Increasing the number of practice questions available to students, potentially including varied question types mirroring the actual exam (multiple-choice, open-ended, and crossword), would significantly improve student preparation and reduce pre-exam anxiety.  Reviewing the exam design to ensure that its structure and content accurately reflect the materials taught in the course is also a worthy consideration.
