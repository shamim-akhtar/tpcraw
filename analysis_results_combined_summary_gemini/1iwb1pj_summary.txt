The Reddit post and comments center on the upcoming Business Law exam at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster expresses anxiety and confusion regarding the limited practice questions and the application of the IRAC method.  Comments offer advice on exam preparation, suggesting focusing on legal principles and remedies rather than strictly adhering to IRAC, and sharing different approaches to answering open-ended questions, including using an open-book strategy to quickly locate relevant information.  The discussion also touches upon the exam format, including the presence of multiple-choice questions, open-ended questions, and a crossword puzzle.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and uncertainty, particularly from the original poster, but also a helpful and supportive community atmosphere.  Comments offer reassurance and practical advice. While the school itself isn't directly criticized,  the limited number of practice questions is highlighted as a source of stress. The open-book nature of the exam is discussed as a key element of exam strategy, emphasizing the importance of knowing the location of information within the allowed materials rather than rote memorization.  The successful experience of one student who received a distinction is also shared, further influencing the tone.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management: The limited number of provided practice questions (only four) for the Business Law exam is a significant concern, contributing to student anxiety and potentially hindering effective exam preparation.  Senior management should consider increasing the number of practice questions available to students to better reflect the breadth and depth of the course material and reduce student stress levels.  A review of the exam format and assessment methods might also be beneficial to determine if adjustments are needed to provide a more balanced and supportive learning environment.
