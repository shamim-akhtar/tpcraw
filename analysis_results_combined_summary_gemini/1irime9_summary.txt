The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of students enrolled in the Information Technology (IIT) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Discussions revolve around the perceived difficulty of the course, specifically in the first year (Y1),  the effectiveness of teaching methods, the adequacy of provided resources and support, and the overall preparedness of students for the industry.  Concerns regarding inconsistencies in marking standards, the reliance on AI tools, and the pacing of the curriculum are also prominent themes.

The overall sentiment is mixed. While some students express positive experiences, praising the hands-on learning opportunities and the quality of school facilities, many voice significant frustrations.  The emotional tone ranges from anxious (the original poster) to critical and even angry towards the IIT department's management and teaching methods.  Specific criticisms target the curriculum's pace, the perceived inadequacy of support for projects (particularly the ADEV/DBAV module), vague marking schemes (NECT), and inconsistencies in teaching styles and marking standards across different lecturers.  Positive comments highlight the quality of resources (though noting that these need better organization and signposting), and the practical relevance of the curriculum to industry needs.

Senior management at TP's IIT department should address several key concerns.  First, a review of the Y1 curriculum's pace and structure is necessary, particularly in light of the numerous comments suggesting it's too slow initially but leaves students ill-prepared for the increased rigor of subsequent years.  Second, the provision of support materials and resources needs improvement.  While resources exist, their accessibility and organization must be enhanced to ensure students can easily find relevant support for all modules, and not just those (like DSAG) which already have good extra resources. Third, the inconsistencies in marking standards and teaching styles across lecturers require immediate attention. Implementing clearer rubrics and standardized assessment procedures for all modules would alleviate student anxieties and ensure fairness.  Finally, better communication to students on the expectations of self-directed learning in the IT industry needs to be established, while also providing explicit guidance on resources to supplement that self-learning. A clearer emphasis on the importance of practical application and exploration of industry-relevant tools, alongside the theoretical content, would be beneficial.
