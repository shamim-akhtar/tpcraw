The Reddit post and comments center on a prospective Temasek Polytechnic student's concerns about the Business Process and Systems Engineering course.  The student's main questions revolve around module difficulty, internship opportunities, and the overall course's potential for boredom, stemming from a lack of strong engineering background but interest in business.  A current student responds, offering insights into workload, module difficulty, internship prospects, and the general academic culture within the Business and Engineering schools.

The overall sentiment is a mix of apprehension and pragmatic advice. The prospective student expresses anxiety about their course choice and potential struggles with the engineering aspects.  The commenter provides a relatively balanced perspective, acknowledging the lighter workload in the Business school compared to Engineering, while highlighting the importance of interest and aptitude for success in either field. The mention of the School of Business being "slack" is presented as a common experience across similar institutions, not a unique criticism of Temasek Polytechnic.  The internship opportunities, specifically the OCBC compliance internship, are viewed positively.  There's a lack of detailed commentary on specific facilities.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management: While not directly critical, the comments suggest an opportunity to improve pre-enrollment advising.  The commenter notes the student should have considered these questions before submitting their application.  This highlights a potential gap in the clarity or comprehensiveness of course information provided to prospective students.  Improving pre-enrollment resources, perhaps by including more detailed accounts of the course workload and expectations from current students or alumni, could better prepare applicants and reduce post-enrollment anxieties.  Furthermore, showcasing a wider range of internship opportunities beyond a single example (OCBC compliance) might provide a more comprehensive picture for prospective students.
