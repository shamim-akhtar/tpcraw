The Reddit post and its comments center on the suitability of using an iPad versus a MacBook for a Communication Design course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The original poster (OP) inquires about iPad compatibility, sparking a discussion among current and former TP students, predominantly from the Communication Design (CMD) course, who overwhelmingly advise against relying solely on an iPad.  The consensus emphasizes the limitations of iPad software compatibility with industry-standard design applications like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects, and the frequent crashes experienced even with adjustments.  Many recommend a MacBook Pro, or at least a high-performance Windows laptop, as a more practical and future-proof choice.

The overall sentiment is strongly negative towards using only an iPad for the CMD course at TP.  The comments express concern about software limitations, potential crashes, and the overall inadequacy of the iPad for professional design work.  There's a clear sense of frustration and even exasperation from students who have experienced these issues firsthand.  Several comments directly mention specific software (Adobe Creative Suite, Figma), hardware (MacBook Pro, high-end Windows laptops), and the impact of inadequate equipment on their workflow.  A recurring positive mention is the MacBook Pro's performance and reliability for these design applications. Budget and affordability are also addressed, with suggestions for affordable but capable Windows alternatives.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should consider the following:  First, the significant number of student comments highlighting the limitations of using iPads for the CMD course necessitates a review of the course's technology requirements.  Second,  the school should provide clear and comprehensive guidelines on minimum hardware specifications for the CMD program, addressing the software compatibility issues raised by students.  Third,  exploring partnerships with tech companies to offer student discounts or subsidized hardware options could address the affordability concerns raised by some students.  Finally, clear communication about the importance of having suitable equipment for success in the course should be integrated into the admissions and course orientation materials.
