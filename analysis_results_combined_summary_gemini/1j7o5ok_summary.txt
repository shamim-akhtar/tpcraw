The Reddit post and comments center on a student's concern regarding an error made on their application for the Ministry of Education (MOE) tuition grant. The student, attending Temasek Polytechnic (TP), mistakenly listed their previous course instead of their current one.  The post seeks advice and updates after contacting TP about the issue, but hasn't yet received a response.  A commenter suggests resubmitting the application.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and desperation. The student expresses distress ("HEY GUYS😭," "What do i do?🥲")  due to the error and the lack of response from TP.  The commenter offers helpful advice, resulting in a shift to gratitude ("Tysm😭🙏").  No specific mention is made about TP's school facilities or other aspects beyond the administrative process related to tuition grant applications. There is no discussion of the school's curriculum or teaching quality.

While the situation is resolved by the advice received from other users, a concern for TP's administrative responsiveness is warranted.  Senior management should review the response time for student inquiries, particularly those related to financial aid.  The aim should be to ensure quicker turnaround times for such crucial matters to alleviate student stress and anxiety.  Improving communication channels and providing clearer guidelines regarding application corrections could also enhance the student experience.
