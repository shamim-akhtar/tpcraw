The Reddit post and comment discuss a student's unsuccessful attempt to register for a Global Studies (GS) trip to China offered by Temasek Polytechnic.  The main issue is the student's frustration with the online registration system, encountering technical difficulties that resulted in missing the opportunity to participate in the trip.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and frustrated. The student expresses significant disappointment and despair at missing the China trip, using emotive language like "ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­" and "ðŸ¥²". The comment further exacerbates the negative tone with sarcastic humor, referencing "social credit,"  highlighting the student's perceived unfairness and the impact of the technical glitch on their experience.  No specific mention is made of the school's facilities or other aspects beyond the online registration system for the GS trip.

The technical difficulties experienced with the online registration system for the Global Studies trip to China warrant attention. Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the functionality of their online application and registration system for such programs to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, particularly around concurrent user access and error handling.  Improving the system's robustness and user-friendliness would prevent similar frustrations for future students.  Investigating the possibility of implementing a queuing system that prevents duplicate registrations would also be beneficial.
