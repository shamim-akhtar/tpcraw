The Reddit post and comments primarily center around the Temasek Polytechnic (TP) scholarship.  The main discussion revolves around whether scholarship recipients have already been notified, whether rejection notifications are sent, and whether the scholarship selection process is biased towards business students.  Several commenters express concern about a perceived lack of transparency in the scholarship announcement and allocation.

The overall sentiment is a mix of anxious anticipation and mild disappointment.  While one commenter confirms that some students have received the scholarship, others express frustration and a sense of unfairness, particularly regarding the apparent favoritism towards business students. The comments regarding the scholarship application process reveal a lack of clarity and information on communication protocols for both successful and unsuccessful applicants.  No specific facilities or aspects of the school itself were mentioned beyond the implied concern about potential bias within the Business and possibly Applied Science (ASC) school departments.

Based on the comments, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should review the scholarship selection process to ensure fairness and transparency. Specifically, they should address the perceived bias towards business students and implement clearer communication protocols regarding scholarship outcomes.  This includes ensuring that all applicants, whether successful or unsuccessful, receive timely notification of the decision.   Increased transparency in the selection criteria and a broader outreach program could alleviate concerns and improve the overall perception of the scholarship program.
