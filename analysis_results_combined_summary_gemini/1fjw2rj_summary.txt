The Reddit post and comments primarily center around a student's inability to access their GPA on the Temasek Polytechnic Online Student Portal System (TPOSS).  The student reports a "session expired" error despite password changes and attempts on different devices.  Other users suggest troubleshooting steps like reloading the page, using a different device, and checking for software updates.

The overall sentiment is one of mild frustration and concern. The student expresses disappointment ("still didn't work ðŸ˜“") at their unsuccessful attempts to access their GPA.  The comments offer helpful, albeit basic, troubleshooting suggestions, maintaining a relatively neutral and supportive tone.  The discussion focuses solely on the functionality of the TPOSS website and doesn't express opinions about the school, its facilities, or other aspects beyond this specific technical issue.

For Temasek Polytechnic senior management, the recurring issue reported by the student regarding inability to access GPA through TPOSS warrants attention.  The fact that a student encountered the "session expired" error despite password changes and using different devices suggests a potential flaw in the system's login or session management functionality. A review of the TPOSS system's stability and user experience, particularly concerning login procedures and error handling, is recommended.  Improved error messages providing more specific guidance and readily accessible support channels might also enhance the student experience.
