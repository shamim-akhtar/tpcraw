The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic student's academic struggles.  The student experienced a significant drop in grades from semester one to semester two, expressing feelings of burnout and demotivation.  Comments offer support and advice, focusing on the challenges of transitioning from O Levels to polytechnic studies, the impact of specific modules (like communication),  the importance of intrinsic motivation, and the need for improved time management.  The overall discussion touches upon academic pressure, peer comparisons, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the polytechnic curriculum.

The overall sentiment is one of empathy and support.  While the original poster expresses frustration and self-criticism, the comments offer encouragement and practical advice.  There is a shared understanding of the intense academic pressure and the challenges inherent in adapting to a new learning environment.  The mention of "communication modules" highlights a specific area of concern regarding curriculum effectiveness. The comments also highlight concerns regarding the difficulty of transitioning from O levels to polytechnic studies for students with no prior background in their chosen field.  No specific facilities at the school are mentioned directly in the post.

Based on the comments, I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management consider reviewing the effectiveness of the communication modules.  The comments suggest that the grading for these modules may be inconsistent or heavily reliant on individual lecturers, leading to student dissatisfaction and impacting overall GPA. Additionally,  support systems addressing the transition from O Levels to polytechnic studies, particularly for students lacking prior exposure to their chosen field, should be explored.  These could include additional academic advising, bridging courses, or peer mentorship programs.  Addressing these issues could improve student well-being and academic performance.
