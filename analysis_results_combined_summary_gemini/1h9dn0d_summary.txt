The Reddit post and comments center on student dissatisfaction with Temasek Polytechnic's "Innova" module.  Key issues include the perceived irrelevance of the module's content to some courses, frustration with conflicting project guidelines from multiple modules, and the previous grading system which negatively impacted some students' GPAs.  Students also expressed feelings of being overwhelmed, resorting to shortcuts like using GPT, and experiencing unprofessional conduct from a lecturer.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by frustration, disappointment, and even anger towards the Innova module.  While some students found aspects enjoyable, the majority express significant dissatisfaction.  Specific complaints target the module's content, its perceived irrelevance to certain courses (especially those outside of design, engineering, and IT), and confusing, conflicting project guidelines across modules. The unprofessional behavior of a lecturer, invading a student's private space, is also a point of serious concern. The mention of TPFun (a presumably mandatory module), and its impact on GPA calculations further adds to the negative sentiment, highlighting the system's perceived flaws.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the following concerns: 1) **Review the Innova module's curriculum and relevance** across all disciplines, potentially tailoring the content to better suit each course's focus or offering elective options. 2) **Standardize project guidelines** where multiple modules intersect to avoid confusion and unnecessary workload for students.  3) **Address the reported unprofessional conduct** by a lecturer and implement measures to prevent similar incidents. 4) **Re-evaluate the weighting of TPFun within the GPA calculation**, given student concerns that it disproportionately impacts academic performance and university applications.   Finally, consider gathering further feedback through surveys or focus groups to gain a broader understanding of student experiences with Innova and other modules.
