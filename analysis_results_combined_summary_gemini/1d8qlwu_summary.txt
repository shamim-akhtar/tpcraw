The Reddit post and comments center on concerns from a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Aviation Management (AMS) student regarding the mathematics modules (Engineering Math 1 & 2) required for the course.  The student, having not studied math for three years, seeks reassurance about the difficulty level and consequences of failing a module.  Other topics discussed include the AMS interview process, including aptitude tests and interview questions, and the workload and difficulty of other modules like computer programming, quantitative methods, and data visualization.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and reassurance.  Current and former AMS students provide positive feedback, emphasizing that the math modules are manageable even for students with gaps in their math knowledge. The Learning Support Group is highlighted as a valuable resource. While there is some anxiety about the math requirements and the interview process, the prevailing tone is supportive and encouraging.  Mentions of school facilities are limited to the Learning Support Group. No negative comments about the school or its facilities are present.  The interview process is described as focusing both on aviation-related knowledge and personal attributes.


The senior management of Temasek Polytechnic should consider providing more detailed and readily accessible information about the mathematics modules in the Aviation Management course on the TP website.  Specifically, the level of mathematics expected should be clearly defined, and information on the support systems available to students (like the Learning Support Group) should be prominently featured.  Clarification on the consequences of failing a core module, beyond the requirement to retake it, would be beneficial for prospective students. Finally, publicizing the typical format and content of the AMS aptitude test and interview would reduce student anxiety and better prepare applicants.
