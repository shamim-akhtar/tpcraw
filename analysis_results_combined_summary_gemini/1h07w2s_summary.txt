The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the importance of English proficiency at Temasek Polytechnic (TP), specifically for first-year students.  The main points of conversation revolve around whether English is a required subject in Year 1, the weight English skills carry in academic performance, and the availability of resources like Grammarly and ChatGPT to improve writing.  Students debated the significance of TPFun general education modules and their impact on GPA calculations.  The OP's course, Biomedical Engineering, and the use of AI writing tools were also mentioned.


The overall sentiment is a mix of concern and reassurance.  While the original poster expresses anxiety about their English skills, several commenters offer advice and alleviate concerns.  The tone is generally helpful and supportive, with many students sharing their experiences and offering practical suggestions, such as utilizing free resources like Grammarly and ChatGPT.  There's some skepticism about the actual effectiveness and benefits of TPFun modules, described as "nonsense" by one commenter.  The availability of a free Grammarly subscription for TP students is highlighted, while doubts were also raised about its capabilities.  Specific mentions of facilities and school resources include the availability of free Grammarly and the TPFun general education modules.


Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should investigate the concerns regarding the effectiveness and perceived value of the TPFun modules.  The comments suggest students find them unnecessary and are unconcerned about the pass/fail grading system.  Furthermore, clarifying the exact features of the provided Grammarly accounts (whether it is a fully functional Pro version) and actively promoting its use among students would be beneficial.  Finally, considering that students are turning to AI tools to overcome their writing weaknesses, the Polytechnic could investigate ways to better integrate these technologies or offer additional support in English language development, potentially through tailored workshops or short courses for those who need help.
