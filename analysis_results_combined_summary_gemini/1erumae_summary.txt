The Reddit post and comment discuss issues with the access control system at Temasek Polytechnic's 1st Avenue campus.  The main problem revolves around the failure of the palm recognition system for both entry and checkout, preventing students from accessing the building and completing checkout procedures. One commenter notes that despite the palm scanner malfunction, they were still able to log in for checkout.

The overall sentiment is one of mild frustration and inconvenience.  The tone is relatively calm and matter-of-fact, reflecting a common technical problem rather than a major crisis. While there's no overt negativity towards Temasek Polytechnic itself, the focus is on the malfunctioning palm recognition system at the 1st Avenue building, suggesting a need for technical maintenance or upgrade.  There's no mention of other school facilities or subjects.


Given the reported issues with the palm recognition system at the 1st Avenue building, I recommend that Temasek Polytechnic's senior management investigate the recurring failure of this access control system.  A prompt assessment of the system's functionality and a plan for repairs or replacement should be implemented to ensure smooth access for students and staff.  Consideration should also be given to providing alternative methods of access during periods of system failure to minimize disruption.
