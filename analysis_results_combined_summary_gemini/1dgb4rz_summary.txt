The Reddit post and comments center on the brevity of assessment feedback received by a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student in the CICT (likely referring to a specific course or department) program.  The student is concerned about the lack of specific improvement suggestions given only "insightful analysis" as feedback and the inability to view a numerical grade, as only a pass/fail status is displayed on Brightspace.  Comments from other students confirm that CICT assessments are often pass/fail and feedback is generally minimal.


The overall sentiment is one of mild concern and confusion, but ultimately acceptance.  While the original poster expresses frustration over the lack of detailed feedback, other commenters reassure them that the short feedback is typical for CICT assessments and that a "pass" indicates satisfactory performance.  There's a slightly humorous undertone in some comments acknowledging that minimal effort suffices for a passing grade. No negative sentiment is directed towards the school, its facilities, or specific lecturers, other than the perceived inadequacy of feedback.


Recommendation for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:  Consider revising the assessment feedback policy for CICT courses. While a pass/fail system may be appropriate, providing more constructive feedback, even for passing assignments, is crucial for student learning and improvement.  The current system of very brief feedback, even just two words, hinders students' understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and limits their opportunities to improve their skills.  More specific feedback guidelines and training for lecturers could help address this issue.
