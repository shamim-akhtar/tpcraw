The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the Hospitality, Tourism, and Management (HTM) course at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The author seeks information about course workload, schedule, dress code, social life, and the overall polytechnic system.  Comments provide insights into the course's stress level, the balance of online and in-person learning, the frequency of formal attire requirements, and the opportunities for socializing outside of classroom settings.  A key concern is balancing academics with a long commute and limited time for extracurricular activities.

The overall sentiment is a mixture of anxiety and cautious optimism.  The author expresses initial apprehension about the course workload and social integration.  Commenters offer reassurance, describing the workload as manageable albeit stressful at times, particularly during presentation periods. While the course demands are noted, the comments also highlight a generally positive outlook toward the social aspects of TP life, albeit requiring proactive effort.  The comments specifically address the schedule (varying across semesters), the importance of attending tutorials, dress code (business casual for some presentations, otherwise flexible), and the need for students to actively seek out social interaction due to limited opportunities outside of their immediate class. The facilities are not directly discussed, however the comments do note the presence of online and face-to-face learning environments.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  Based on the comments, consider providing clearer guidelines on the dress code for various occasions within the HTM course. While flexibility is appreciated, clarifying expectations around formal attire can ease student anxiety.  Additionally,  explore opportunities to facilitate social interaction amongst students, perhaps through organized events or initiatives that cater to students with long commutes and limited time for CCAs.  Finally, proactively communicating the course structure and workload expectations in advance could help manage student anxieties and promote better time management from the outset.
