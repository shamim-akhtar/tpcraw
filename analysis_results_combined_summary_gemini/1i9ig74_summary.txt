The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the starting times of clubs and societies (CCAs) at Temasek Polytechnic (TP). The original poster inquired about whether most CCAs begin late in the evening, referencing the differing timings listed on the Singapore Polytechnic (SP) website.  Commenters confirmed that many TP CCAs indeed start around 7 pm, with some beginning slightly earlier.  Specific CCAs mentioned include Judo and Floorball.

The overall sentiment is neutral and informative.  There is no overtly negative or positive emotional tone.  The comments provide straightforward answers to the original poster's question regarding CCA timings.  The mention of Singapore Polytechnic's website highlights a potential point of comparison for students considering TP,  while the specific mention of Judo and Floorball offers context to the discussion about CCA scheduling. No specific concerns about school facilities are raised.

While no major concerns are explicitly raised in this thread, senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider reviewing the information provided on their website regarding CCA timings to ensure consistency and accuracy.  If SP's website, a comparable institution, is being used as a primary reference point, TP should ensure its own website is equally user-friendly and provides complete and accurate information for prospective students.  This would improve transparency and reduce potential confusion for students researching extracurricular activities.
