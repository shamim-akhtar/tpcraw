The Reddit post and comments center on a student's inquiry about joining Temasek Polytechnic's basketball CCA (Co-curricular Activity) despite lacking prior experience and aiming for competitive play.  The main discussion revolves around the competitiveness of the trials, the likelihood of success for someone without prior experience, and the overall difficulty of entry into sports CCAs at the polytechnic.

The overall sentiment is a mix of helpfulness and realism. While one commenter offers encouragement and suggests trying out regardless, another points out the highly competitive nature of the trials and the low probability of acceptance without prior experience.  The emotional tone is generally supportive but cautious, acknowledging the student's ambition while tempering expectations.  Specific mention is made of the basketball CCA trials and their competitive nature. There is no direct mention of school facilities.

Based on the comments,  senior management at Temasek Polytechnic might consider reviewing the accessibility of sports CCAs for students with little to no prior experience.  While maintaining high standards is important, exploring options such as beginner-level teams or more inclusive trial processes could broaden participation and encourage more students to engage in extracurricular activities.  This could involve creating pathways for students to develop skills and potentially progress to competitive teams over time, thus addressing the competitiveness barrier highlighted in the comments.
