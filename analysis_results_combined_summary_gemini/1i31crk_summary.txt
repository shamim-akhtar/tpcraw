The Reddit post and comments center on the experiences of students in the School of Engineering, specifically the Aviation Management course at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main topic of discussion is the course schedule and daily life within the program, with the original poster seeking information from current or former students.  Due to the lack of comments, there is no further discussion of specific aspects of the course, school facilities, or student life beyond the initial inquiry.

The overall sentiment is neutral and inquisitive. The original poster expresses interest in the Aviation Management course but lacks information about the daily schedule and overall experience.  The absence of comments prevents any further analysis of sentiment regarding specific aspects of the school, its facilities, or the course itself.  There is no detectable positive or negative emotional tone present in the available text.

Given the lack of comments providing any further information, no specific recommendations can be made to senior management at Temasek Polytechnic.  Further engagement with students and potential students through online forums like Reddit could provide valuable feedback regarding course structure, facilities, and overall student experience within the School of Engineering and the Aviation Management program.
