The Reddit post and comments center on students' difficulties in obtaining a color vision test required for admission or enrollment at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Specific concerns include navigating the appointment booking process at SATA (presumably a TP-affiliated clinic), finding alternative walk-in clinics offering the test within a short timeframe (5 working days), and uncertainty regarding submission methods (softcopy vs. printed) for the test results to TP.  The lack of responsiveness from TP via email and phone also generated frustration.


The overall sentiment is one of stress and frustration.  Students express anxiety about meeting the tight deadline for the test,  difficulty in accessing the test, and confusion regarding TP's procedures.  The comments reveal a lack of clarity regarding the appointment process at SATA and a need for more readily available information regarding alternative clinics.  SATA's website is criticized for being confusing.  The short timeframe provided for completing the medical test is repeatedly mentioned as problematic.  Negative experiences with contacting TP for assistance are also highlighted.


**Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic Senior Management:**

1. **Improve Communication and Accessibility:**  The lack of responsiveness from TP and the confusing SATA website need immediate attention.  Consider creating a more user-friendly online portal with clearer instructions on booking appointments, alternative clinic options, and submission procedures for the color vision test.  The short 5-day deadline should be re-evaluated for its feasibility.

2. **Expand Testing Options:**  The difficulty students face in finding clinics that offer the color vision test within the allotted time suggests a need to either expand the list of approved clinics or extend the timeframe for test completion.  Publish a comprehensive list of clinics and their contact information.  This list should also specify whether they accept walk-ins or require appointments.

3. **Streamline Submission Process:** Clarify the accepted method for submitting the completed color vision test form (softcopy vs. printed).  Provide clear instructions to avoid the confusion experienced by students.  This could involve creating a dedicated email address or online portal for test result submissions.
