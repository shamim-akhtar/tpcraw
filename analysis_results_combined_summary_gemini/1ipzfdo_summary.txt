The Reddit post and comments center on students' difficulties in obtaining a color vision test required for admission or enrollment at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  Specific concerns include navigating the appointment booking process at SATA (presumably a TP-affiliated clinic), finding alternative walk-in clinics offering the test within a short timeframe (5 working days), and uncertainty regarding submission procedures (softcopy vs. printed form) for TP.  Several commenters express frustration with the limited availability of the test and the lack of timely responses from TP administration.

The overall sentiment is one of stress, frustration, and confusion.  Students express anxiety about meeting the deadline for the color vision test, highlighting the pressure imposed by the short timeframe.  Negative emotions are directed towards the perceived inconvenience of the process, the confusing SATA website, and the difficulty in finding readily available testing centers.  SATA's accessibility and responsiveness are questioned, along with the lack of clarity regarding TP's submission procedures for the test results. The comments also reveal a lack of readily available information and guidance provided by TP regarding the color vision test, with several students attempting to help each other.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the issues raised regarding the color vision test requirement.  Specifically, they should review and improve the clarity and user-friendliness of the SATA website and appointment booking system.  Consider providing a more comprehensive list of approved clinics offering the test, ideally including information about walk-in availability.  Furthermore, clearer communication regarding submission procedures (softcopy vs. printed forms and acceptable methods of submission) and a more responsive communication channel (email/phone) should be established to alleviate student stress and anxiety surrounding the required medical examination.  Finally, the short timeframe given for completing the test should be reviewed to ensure it's realistic and doesn't cause undue hardship for students.
