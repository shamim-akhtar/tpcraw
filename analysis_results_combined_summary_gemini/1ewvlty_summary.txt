The Reddit post and comments primarily focus on the delayed disbursement of bursary funds to Temasek Polytechnic students.  Several commenters express frustration and anger over the prolonged waiting period, with some reporting approvals dating back to June yet still not having received the money.  The discussion centers on the discrepancy between the Polytechnic's encouragement to apply for bursaries and the significant delay in receiving the approved funds.

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, characterized by frustration, anger, and disappointment.  Commenters use strong language ("pissed off," "knn") to express their dissatisfaction with the delay in receiving their bursaries.  The lack of communication and transparency regarding the disbursement process is a significant source of their frustration.  While one commenter received their bursary months ago, the majority highlight the significant delay and the impact of the school's financial aid system's inefficiency on their finances. The subject of the school's financial aid (bursaries) and the implicit expectation of timely disbursement is the primary focus. No specific facilities are mentioned.

The prolonged delay in disbursing approved bursary funds is a serious concern that requires immediate attention from Temasek Polytechnic senior management.  A thorough review of the bursary application and disbursement processes is urgently needed to identify and rectify the bottlenecks causing these delays.  Improved communication with students regarding the status of their applications and timelines for disbursement is crucial to alleviate frustration and maintain student trust.  Transparency regarding any unforeseen circumstances contributing to the delays should also be proactively communicated to affected students.
