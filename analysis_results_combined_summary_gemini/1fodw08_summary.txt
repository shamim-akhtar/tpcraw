The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) scholarship application.  The main discussion points revolve around what types of achievements to include in the application, specifically whether participation in secondary school competitions and awards like the Edusave award should be listed, and the competitive nature of the scholarship process.  Students are expressing anxiety and comparing their qualifications against others.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and competitiveness.  Students are expressing concern about the rigor of the scholarship application process and comparing their accomplishments (or lack thereof) to others.  While there's a supportive element with users offering advice, the predominant tone is apprehensive.  The comments highlight a perceived need to be a well-rounded student with extensive extracurricular achievements and high grades, putting pressure on applicants.  No direct criticisms of the school, its facilities, or specific subjects are voiced; the focus is entirely on the scholarship application criteria and the perceived difficulty of meeting them.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The comments reveal student anxieties surrounding the scholarship application process.  Clarifying the application guidelines regarding the inclusion of secondary school achievements could alleviate some of this stress.  A review of the scholarship criteria, perhaps emphasizing a broader range of qualities beyond simply competition wins and leadership roles, could foster a more inclusive and less competitive application environment.  Transparency on the weighting of different application components could also help manage student expectations and reduce anxiety.
