The Reddit post and comments center on a Temasek Polytechnic (TP) student's questions regarding participation in Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and their impact on university applications.  Specifically, the student inquires about the necessity of CCAs for SEAL points and resume building, the ideal number of SEAL points to aim for, and the implications of delaying CCA involvement until the second year.  The comments offer varying perspectives on the importance of CCAs, highlighting the significance of CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) over SEAL points for university admissions.


The overall sentiment is largely pragmatic and reassuring. While some acknowledge the value of CCAs for resume enhancement and leadership experience, the consensus emphasizes the paramount importance of a strong CGPA for university applications.  There's a sense of understanding towards the student's initial hesitation due to academic priorities.  No specific negative sentiments are directed toward the school, its facilities, or its programs; the discussion focuses solely on the strategic balancing of academics and extracurricular activities within the TP context.  One comment humorously questions the difficulty of polytechnic studies, implying a wider concern about the balance of coursework and extracurricular commitment.


Concerns/Recommendations for Senior Management: While no direct criticisms are levied, the comments subtly highlight a potential need for clearer communication regarding the relative importance of CGPA versus SEAL points in the university application process. A proactive outreach campaign emphasizing the value of a strong CGPA while simultaneously highlighting opportunities for well-rounded development through CCAs could alleviate student anxieties about this balance.  This could involve updated guidelines and resources clarifying the weight given to SEAL points by universities and providing tailored advice on managing academic and extracurricular commitments.
