The Reddit post and comments center around a student's desperate plea to have someone withdraw from a Global Studies Bali trip.  The student offers to compensate ("blanje") the individual for withdrawing.  No further details regarding the reasons behind the plea or any responses are provided in the given text.


The overall sentiment is one of extreme urgency and desperation. The author uses repetitive pleading, suggesting a significant level of stress or anxiety related to the Bali trip.  There is no mention of Temasek Polytechnic itself, its facilities, or any specific aspects of the Global Studies program beyond the Bali trip. The lack of comments prevents analysis of broader sentiment towards the school.


Given the limited information, there are no specific recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management. However, the post highlights a potential student welfare concern.  It would be beneficial to investigate mechanisms for students to address travel-related issues and anxieties more effectively, perhaps by providing clearer cancellation policies or counseling support for students facing significant stress related to academic trips.  Further investigation into the reason behind the student's plea might also reveal areas for improvement in program management.
