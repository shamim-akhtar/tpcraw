The Reddit post and comments center around a student's distress regarding an impending deadline for a DSAG (likely a Diploma in Systems and Applications Development) assignment at Temasek Polytechnic (TP).  The comments offer a mix of humorous, dismissive, and supportive responses, with some referencing the intense workload experienced by students in the Information Technology (IIT) school.  There's also a general sense of camaraderie amongst students facing similar academic pressures.


The overall sentiment is one of lighthearted stress and shared experience.  While the initial post expresses anxiety about a tight deadline, the comments largely deflect this with jokes and relatable experiences.  The mention of IIT suggests a particularly challenging academic environment within that specific school at TP, with comments emphasizing the difficulty of surviving the first year.  There is no direct mention of specific school facilities.


Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management could stem from the implicit indication of a potentially high-pressure academic environment within the IIT school, potentially leading to student burnout.  The comments suggest a need to review the workload and deadlines for DSAG assignments within IIT to ensure they are manageable and conducive to student well-being.  Further investigation into student experiences within IIT could reveal areas for improvement in course design or support systems.
