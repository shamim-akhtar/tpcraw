The Reddit post and its comments center on a student's inquiry regarding appealing a Non-Graded Pass (NGP) received for a 4-credit module. The student explains their absences were due to recurring morning sickness on Wednesdays, but they failed to obtain medical certificates (MCs).  The core issue revolves around the possibility of appealing the NGP given the circumstances.


The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and frustration from the student, expressing regret for not obtaining MCs.  The tone is apologetic and seeks understanding and guidance.  There's no direct mention of the school's facilities or specific subjects involved, only the impact of the absences on academic performance and the resulting NGP in a 4-credit module.


Based on the limited information, I recommend Temasek Polytechnic's senior management review their appeals process for NGPs, ensuring its clarity and accessibility to students.  Consider providing clearer communication regarding the importance of obtaining MCs for absences and potentially offering support for students experiencing health challenges that impact their attendance, like an easily accessible online MC application portal or improved communication of existing support systems.  The ease of appealing a NGP, given extenuating circumstances, should also be reviewed to ensure fairness and support student well-being.
