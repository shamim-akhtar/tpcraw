The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the frequency with which "Care" classes change at Temasek Polytechnic's School of Business.  The original poster inquired about whether these classes change semesters or yearly, while the comments offered conflicting information: one stating yearly changes within the School of Business, and another suggesting no change for three years unless in a common curriculum.


The overall sentiment is one of mild curiosity and helpfulness.  The tone is informal and friendly.  The comments provide direct responses to the original poster's question regarding the School of Business's "Care" classes.  There is no negative sentiment expressed towards the school, its facilities, or any other aspects beyond the specific question regarding curriculum changes.


While no major concerns are raised, the conflicting information regarding the frequency of "Care" class changes warrants a brief clarification from Temasek Polytechnic's School of Business senior management.  To ensure consistent communication with students, it is recommended that the school standardize its messaging on the curriculum's stability, specifically regarding "Care" classes, and clearly communicate this information to students across all communication channels. This will prevent confusion and ensure students are well-informed about their academic schedule.
