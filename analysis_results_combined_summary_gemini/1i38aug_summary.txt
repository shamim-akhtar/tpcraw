The Reddit post and comments center around a prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) Aerospace Engineering student's questions about the course.  These questions pertain to class groupings based on L1R4 scores, recommended devices for studying (specifically iPads vs. Windows laptops for CAD software and mathematical computations), the quality of teaching and learning resources, and the potential challenges of group projects impacting GPA.  Comments provide insights from current students regarding these concerns.

The overall sentiment is a mixture of anxiety and cautious optimism. The original poster expresses apprehension about group work and choosing the right device.  Current students offer reassuring yet realistic responses. While some praise the enthusiastic lecturers and available resources, others mention less engaging instructors and the significant workload associated with online lectures and the SAR-147 hours requirement. Concerns are raised about the potential negative impact of lazy group members on individual GPAs and the discrepancy between MCs/LOAs and SAR-147 hour attendance tracking.  The school's facilities and resources are mentioned positively in terms of the BYOD program and the provided specifications list for devices, but some students report difficulties using non-compliant hardware.

Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic should address the following:  First, clarify the process for handling discrepancies between medical leave (MCs/LOAs) and the SAR-147 hour attendance system. Second, review the effectiveness of online lectures and consider supplementing them with more engaging teaching methods to improve student engagement. Finally, evaluate the efficacy of the group project structure within the Aerospace Engineering course, perhaps exploring alternative approaches to mitigate the negative impact of less-engaged group members on overall GPA and to provide better avenues for students to address such situations.  The provided specification list for devices is positive, but better communication around the BYOD financial assistance program's timeline is recommended to avoid unnecessary delays and stress for students.
