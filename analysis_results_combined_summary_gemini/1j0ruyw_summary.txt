The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss the timing of acceptance/rejection notifications for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) Common Engineering course. The original poster (OP) inquires about when they can expect to hear back, while a commenter clarifies the application process and advises checking the TP application portal regularly for updates.  The conversation also briefly touches upon the differences in application processes between local and foreign students.

The overall sentiment is one of helpfulness and anticipation.  The OP expresses anxiety and uncertainty about the application status, while the commenter offers reassuring and practical advice, guiding the OP towards utilizing the TP application portal for updates.  No specific negative sentiments are expressed towards the school, its facilities, or its staff. However, the implied stress related to the application process itself, along with the brief mention of a limited enrolment window, hints at a potential area for improvement.

While the comments provide helpful advice, the short enrolment window mentioned warrants consideration.  Senior management at Temasek Polytechnic could review the duration of the enrolment period to ensure sufficient time for students to process acceptance offers and complete necessary paperwork.  This might involve extending the timeframe or offering more comprehensive guidance and support during the enrolment process, potentially addressing any stress related to deadlines and reducing the potential for delays or missed opportunities.
