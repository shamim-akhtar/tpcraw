The Reddit post and comments primarily focus on the curriculum and expectations for the second semester of Year 2 in the Information Technology (IT) diploma program at Temasek Polytechnic.  The discussion includes inquiries about programming languages taught, module descriptions, and the grading of specific modules like Global Studies (GS) and Agile Methodology Design Thinking (AMDT).  A student seeks advice from seniors on what to anticipate in the coming semester.

The overall sentiment is somewhat mixed. While the initial post expresses anticipation and a desire for guidance, a senior student's comment describes the semester as "boring," mentioning repetitive website and mobile app development projects. However, the same senior student also highlights the value of the AMDT module, specifically its practical application in the industry and the availability of a certification.  There's a slightly negative mention of a Global Studies instructor, described as "a piece of work,"  but overall,  the comments lack strong negative emotion.  No specific issues with school facilities are raised.

Concerns for Temasek Polytechnic senior management should focus on addressing the perceived repetitiveness of projects mentioned by the senior student ("build websites 3 times and a crappy mobile app").  An evaluation of the curriculum and projects within the IT program is warranted to ensure variety and engagement.  Furthermore, while one module (AMDT) is positively highlighted, the negative comment regarding a Global Studies instructor ("a piece of work") warrants attention and investigation into potential pedagogical issues within that specific module or instructor performance.
