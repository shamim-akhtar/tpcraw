The Reddit post and comments primarily discuss preparation for the Common ICT course at Temasek Polytechnic.  The author expresses some regret about their enrollment but seeks advice on what to expect and how to prepare.  Comments offer suggestions such as learning Python, familiarizing oneself with tools like Figma, Power BI, and KNIME.  Concerns are also raised regarding the Integrated Innovation Technology (IIT) building's aging infrastructure, specifically its limited accessibility due to insufficient elevators.

The overall sentiment is a mix of anxiety and reassurance.  While the initial post reflects some apprehension about the Common ICT course, fueled by perceived negative feedback about the IIT module, subsequent comments attempt to alleviate these concerns.  The comments suggest that curriculum adjustments have been made, implying a positive response to student feedback.  The emotional tone is generally supportive and helpful.  The discussion mentions the IIT building's architecture as outdated but not inherently negative, primarily focusing on its accessibility issues, specifically the limited number of elevators in relation to student volume.  The school's facilities, particularly the IIT building's elevators and stairs, are directly mentioned as a source of potential inconvenience.

Concerns for senior management at Temasek Polytechnic center around the accessibility of the IIT building.  The comments highlight the inadequate number of elevators for the high volume of students using the building, resulting in significant inconvenience and potential safety hazards.  Investing in additional elevators or exploring alternative accessibility solutions should be considered to improve the student experience and ensure safety.  A review of the IIT building's infrastructure and accessibility for students with disabilities is warranted.
