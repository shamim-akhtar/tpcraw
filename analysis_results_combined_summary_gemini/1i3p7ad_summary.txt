The Reddit post and comments center on difficulties students are experiencing in the Business Law (BLM1007) module at Temasek Polytechnic.  The main issues discussed include the perceived inadequacy of the lecturer's teaching style, specifically their tendency to provide confusing and overly complex explanations, and the lack of clear guidance on answering exam questions. Students are seeking advice on answer structuring, relevant resources, and effective study strategies for the upcoming exam. The use of external resources, particularly "Singapore Law Watch" and "Lexis Advance," is heavily recommended.

The overall sentiment is one of frustration and confusion among students regarding the Business Law module.  The lecturer is criticized for their teaching approach, described as "terrible" and leading to student confusion.  While some students express positive experiences with other lecturers, the prevailing tone regarding the particular Business Law lecturer is overwhelmingly negative.  There's also anxiety regarding the exam and a desire for practical advice on answer structuring.  No specific facilities are mentioned beyond the implied lack of helpful teaching resources from the lecturer within the classroom setting.


Concerns and recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management:  The significant number of negative comments regarding the teaching style and effectiveness of the head of the Business Law module necessitates investigation.  Student feedback clearly indicates a need for improved teaching methods and clearer guidance on exam preparation.  Senior management should consider providing additional support for students in this module, perhaps through workshops focusing on exam technique and the application of legal principles.  The reliance on external resources like "Singapore Law Watch" and "Lexis Advance" suggests a gap in the course materials or their effective delivery.  A review of the curriculum and teaching methodologies should be undertaken to ensure that the module effectively equips students with the necessary skills and knowledge.  Anonymous student feedback mechanisms should be implemented to allow for the honest expression of concerns about teaching staff without fear of reprisal.
