The Reddit post and comments center on a student, ILoveTravel101, who narrowly missed their desired Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) score for Temasek Polytechnic's (TP) fashion design course (FMD) but is desperate to gain admission.  The discussion focuses on exploring alternative application pathways, such as contacting the course chair directly, and seeking advice on navigating the Direct Admission Exercise (DAE) Phase 2 application process.  The student expresses significant anxiety and passion for fashion design.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and hope. The student expresses intense desire to attend TP's FMD course, conveying significant disappointment and worry about not meeting the initial JAE score.  The comments offer supportive advice and practical solutions, creating a generally positive and helpful atmosphere.  While the student's emotional state is a significant element, there is no explicit negative sentiment directed towards the school, its facilities, or the FMD course itself; rather, the focus is on gaining admission.

Recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management are limited given the context.  However, the situation highlights a potential area for improvement: the accessibility of information regarding alternative application pathways after the JAE.  Consider improving the clarity and availability of information on DAE Phase 2 and the possibility of contacting course chairs for special circumstances on the TP website or student portal.  This would reduce student anxiety and provide a more transparent application process.  Specifically, making contact information for course chairs more readily available and clear guidelines on approaching them could be beneficial.
