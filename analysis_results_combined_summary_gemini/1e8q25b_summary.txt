The Reddit post and comments center on prospective Temasek Polytechnic (TP) students seeking advice on Early Admission Exercise (EAE) interviews.  Specifically, the discussion focuses on the types of questions asked during these interviews across various courses, particularly Business, and requests for interview preparation tips from past interviewees.  Several commenters share their interview experiences, detailing questions related to course electives, personal contributions, business experience, future career aspirations, knowledge of global economic conditions, leadership skills, and extracurricular activities.

The overall sentiment is one of anxiety and anticipation mixed with helpfulness.  The original poster expresses significant nervousness ("I NEED TO PREPðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"), while other commenters offer supportive advice and share their past experiences in a friendly manner.  The comments reveal a positive perception of the interview process itself, albeit a stressful one.  There is no direct criticism of TP's interview process or facilities; instead, the focus is on gaining practical advice for navigating the interview successfully.  The school is implicitly viewed as a desirable institution, given the applicants' eagerness to gain admission.

No specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic's senior management are directly expressed in this Reddit thread.  The discussion purely revolves around the student experience of the EAE interview process and does not uncover any systemic issues with the school, its facilities, or its programs.
