The Reddit post advertises two internship positions – a Medical Escort & Transport (MET) intern and a Gym Tonic intern –  at an IPC and NCSS member organization in the north of Singapore, paying $800/month and starting in September 2023.  The post specifically targets students pursuing a Diploma in Gerontology at Temasek Polytechnic, though others whose courses allow for graded internships are also welcome to apply. The application deadline is late June.


The overall sentiment is neutral and informative. The post itself is purely transactional, focusing on providing details about the internship opportunities.  There are no comments provided, thus preventing analysis of sentiment toward the school, its facilities, or specific subjects related to the internship.  The mention of the Gerontology diploma suggests a connection to a specific Temasek Polytechnic program, but no opinions or evaluations of the program are present in either the post or the comments.


Given the lack of comments, there are no specific concerns or recommendations for Temasek Polytechnic senior management related to this post.  Further analysis would require more user interaction and comments to assess student perception of the Gerontology program and related facilities or the school's overall internship placement success.
